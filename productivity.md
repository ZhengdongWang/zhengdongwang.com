# Productivity

prod tips are really fun

everyone in tech has one

really easy for me to get sucked in

some of the worst ive felt was when i didn't do something

the secret these Really Successful and Productive Forces of Nature

mental health but don't follow the language

wait a minute, isn't this pointing out also a kind of virtue signalling

my productivity above all the normies

ok, yes, and maybe pointing out virtue signalling is also

it's hard to write productivity advice and be humble ok

just believe me

<!-- ## Hardware -->

text
* Keyboard: [Leopold FC750R PD](https://www.leopold.co.kr/Shop/Item.php?ItId=1550022044) with brown switches. If it's [good enough for The Machine](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Pro_gear), it's good enough for me! The color is crucial.
* Mouse: [Logitech G402](https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/gaming-mice/g402-hyperion-fury-fps-gaming-mouse.910-004067.html). It's not that fancy.

<!-- ## Software -->

text
* Todo app: [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). I used to use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).
  * Reasons why Things > other todo apps.
