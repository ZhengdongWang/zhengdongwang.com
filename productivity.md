title: Productivity advice
---

Reading productivity advice is really fun for me. It's a great way to procrastinate. Don't worry about all the work I'm not doing now. I'm improving my system, which is even more important! In fact, with this new system I'll be so much more productive than I was before. I'll easily make up for not working now, right?

At the same time I take productivity advice too seriously. If you're actively looking for productivity essays to read (like me), you might be like me. This section is for you. Some of the worst I've felt about myself was guilt over not being more productive after reading other people's advice. Here are these Really Smart and Successful People who are Productive Forces of Nature. They have it all figured out, and they're even feeding me the steps. Why can I not simply Be Better.

I can identify "this one weird trick" and "doctors hate 'em!" as scams pretty easily. Productivity advice is a better concealed scam. Nobody ever becomes 10X or even 2X more productive after reading a self-help book or starting the Pomodoro Technique.

Honestly! Here are two hopefully clarifying reasons why, with very original names from me:

1. No Free Lunch: You are no more productive after implementing a productivity trick than you were before.
  * You're using the same willpower to adhere to your new productivity trick as you were to stop procrastinating. It's the same crappy willpower.
  * You will optimize to be as lazy as possible within the constraints of your new trick.
  * You will exploit the unique weaknesses of your new trick.
  * You will feel a false sense of productivity having implemented your new trick.
2. Efficient Markets: If there existed a productivity trick that you could feasibly implement and actually made you 2X more productive, you've already implemented it.
  * I've met people who are 2X more productive than other people. But have you met anyone who suddenly forced themselves to be 2X more productive? Not me.

Oh you want some "empirical evidence" ok:

* Alexey Guzey has some good examples of [every productivity system stops working eventually and there’s nothing you can do about it](https://guzey.com/productivity/#every-productivity-system-stops-working-eventually-and-theres-nothing-you-can-do-about-it).
* Another example of the holy grail not existing is in [how famous creative people allegedly spent their time](https://podio.com/site/creative-routines). Notice how literally anything will work.

So what to do. Well I try to:

* Realize productivity advice is just for fun. I like playing those farming games where you can rearrange your plots and sprinklers so your farm is more efficient. Imagining the marginal efficiency improvements is the fun part for me. If my farm was super important to my life, it would no longer be fun.
* Stop caring about productivity. Work is but a narrow sliver of the full range of human experience. Go outside.
* Be nice to yourself. Everybody sucks at not procrastinating.
  * Taylor Swift: [this is me trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdLTPNrlEg).

Okay now that you know that time for what you came for.

**Everybody is saying the same thing.** At least, it looks that way from the quotes I picked. I grouped the things people into what I think is the same about them. You should read the original essays just to make sure. Another reason to read them in full is because I quoted only the parts that are relevant to my life, which is not your life.

(By the way, the counterexample to "everybody is saying the same thing is [Agnes Callard](https://twitter.com/AgnesCallard/status/1503108298349838336).)

## Think about direction

{{ altman_productivity }}

> It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!...

> I make sure to leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best ways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people, and spending time in nature...

> The right goal is to allocate your year optimally, not your day...

> Finally, to repeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything at all.  Think more about what to work on.

{{ autotranslucence }}

> The way to extraordinary growth and changes often involves a fundamental ontological or ‘lens’ shift in how you see the world. Magicians are wearing not just better, but fundamentally differently shaped lenses to the rest of us...

> ‘What are the things I say I value but don’t act as if I value, and what would my life feel like on inside if I actually acted as if I valued those things?’

{{ dijkstra }}

> Remember that research with a big R is rarely mission-oriented and plan in terms of decades, not years. Resist all pressure —be it financial or cultural— to do work that is of ephemeral significance at best.

{{ hamming }}

> There are many right problems, but very few people search carefully for them. Rather they simply drift along doing what comes to them, following the easiest path to tomorrow. Great scientists all spend a lot of time and effort in examining the important problems in their field. Many have a list of 10 to 20 problems that might be important if they had a decent attack. As a result, when they notice something new that they had not known but seems to be relevant, then they are prepared to turn to the corresponding problem, work on it, and get there first.

{{ glass }}

> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this.

{{ arkani-hamed2 }}

> The wonderful thing about truth is that it's a great attractor. All you have to do is to get somewhere in its vicinity, and also not fight it.

> If more people realized this, I think we'd get many more people interested in doing physics, in actually doing it, because having the truth out there as a friend and something that you're sort of looking for and trying to head towards, is a tremendous leveler of the playing field when it comes to talents, inclination, are you strong mathematically, not strong mathematically. Having nature as a guide and a friend makes a humongous difference, because people of vastly different levels of talent and, of course you have to be very dedicated, but still, I mean, you can have very, very, you can be fast worker, slow worker. All of these things sort of pale to being somewhere in the vicinity of the right answer.

> And you just have to sort of head towards there, figure out some way of getting there, and just sort of keep at it, keep asking, keep following the important questions, and see the light sort of through the thicket and get closer and closer to it... it doesn't much matter if you have a bulldozer or if you have just a machete, or even a little crappy knife to go through the thicket. You'll get there. But it's important to get in its vicinity.

{{ alexander }}

> In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which inhibits young professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance of standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is as good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, "Of course not, that isn’t what I am trying to do. . . . I could never do that."

> Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must be our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is worthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings, and it is what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the students that they have a right to ask this of themselves, and must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is in their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do better, how to make something that is as profound as that.

> Two things emanate from this changed standard. First, the work becomes more fun. It is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring, because one can never really attain this standard. One's work becomes a lifelong work, and one keeps trying and trying. So it becomes very fulfilling, to live in the light of a goal like this. But secondly, it does change what people are trying to do. It takes away from them the everyday, lower-level aspiration that is purely technical in nature, (and which we have come to accept) and replaces it with something deep, which will make a real difference to all of us that inhabit the earth.

In some sense, the following is also about direction, from world and Olympic record holder, world and Olympic speed skating champion,

{{ van_der_poel }}

> But as soon as the Specific season started I changed focus to doing laps at competition speed on the ice. I now completely subsided from the threshold training in order to free up energy to spend on skating laps on the ice. I never skated slower than competition speed due to two reasons. Firstly (1) I consider technique to be altered to a specific speed. So as I was skating at a slower speed I contaminated my competition speed technique. Secondly (2) I didn’t want to wear out, or tire, my legs by skating slowly as the number of competition speed-laps I could perform weekly would decrease if I wasted my
energy by also going slow on the ice.

## There's nothing special about being good (rather, work really hard)

Yeah, I know this just sounds like "be better." Sorry. But this is a big section, it really is what people say.

{{ chambliss }}

> The mundanity of excellence is typically unrecognized. I think the reason is fairly simple. Usually we see great athletes only after they have become great-after the years of learning the new methods, gaining the habits of competitiveness and consistency, after becoming comfortable in their world. They have long since perfected the myriad of techniques that together constitute excellence. Ignorant of all of the specific steps that have led to the performance and to the confidence, we think that somehow excellence sprang fullgrown from this person, and we say he or she "has talent" or "is gifted." Even when seen close up, the mundanity of excellence is often not believed:

>  Every week at the Mission Viejo training pool, where the National Champion Nadadores team practiced, coaches from around the world would be on the deck visiting, watching as the team did their workouts, swimming back and forth for hours. The visiting coaches would be excited at first, just to be here; then, soon-within an hour or so, usually-they grew bored, walking back and forth looking at the deck, glancing around at the hills around the town, reading the bulletin boards, glancing down at their watches, wondering, after the long flight out to California, when something dramatic was going to happen. "They all have to come to Mecca, and see what we do," coach Mark Schubert said. "They think we have some big secret."

>  But of course there is no secret; there is only the doing of all those little things, each one done correctly, time and again, until excellence in every detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit, an ordinary part of one's everyday life.

{{ wallace }}

> If you've played tennis at least a little, you probably have some idea how hard a game is to play really well. I submit to you that you really have no idea at all. I know I didn't. And television doesn't really allow you to appreciate what real top-level players can do–how hard they're actually hitting the ball, and with what control and tactical imagination and artistry. I got to watch Michael Joyce practice several times right up close, like six feet and a chain-link fence away. This is a man who, at full run, can hit a fast-moving tennis ball into a one-foot square area seventy-eight feet away over a net, hard. He can do this something like more than 90 percent of the time. And this is the world's seventy-ninth-best player, one who has to play the Montreal qualies...

> Americans revere athletic excellence, competitive success, and it's more than lip service we pay; we vote with our wallets. We'll pay large sums to watch a truly great athlete; we'll reward him with celebrity and adulation and will even go so far as to buy products and services he endorses.

> But it's better for us not to know the kinds of sacrifices the professional-grade athlete has made to get so very good at one particular thing. Oh, we'll invoke lush clichés about the lonely heroism of Olympic athletes, the pain and analgesia of football, the early rising and hours of practice and restricted diets, the preflight celibacy, et cetera. But the actual facts of the sacrifices repel us when we see them: basketball geniuses who cannot read, sprinters who dope themselves, defensive tackles who shoot up with bovine hormones until they collapse or explode. We prefer not to consider closely the shockingly vapid and primitive comments uttered by athletes in postcontest interviews or to consider what impoverishments in one's mental life would allow people actually to think the way great athletes seem to think.  Note the way "up close and personal" profiles of professional athletes strain so hard to find evidence of a rounded human life–outside interests and activities, values beyond the sport. We ignore what's obvious, that most of this straining is farce. It's farce because the realities of top-level athletics today require an early and total commitment to one area of excellence. An ascetic focus. A subsumption of almost all other features of human life to one chosen talent and pursuit. A consent to live in a world that, like a child's world, is very small.

Read the last two essays in full. It's worth it.

{{ van_der_poel }}

> Instead the main idea of my training program was that you will become good at whatever it is that you train. The idea was that whoever skated the most laps of 30,0 during the last three months prior to the competition would win the 10k.

And,

> True self confidence comes from experience. My very race specific ice sessions supplied me with the facts of my capacity and the trust in myself. I wasn’t mentaly strong as a kid, I hated to compete ever since I started speed skating, I truly hated it. It is still a little anxiety provoking for me, I think it always will be when I test myself in an activity that I really care about. But today it’s a walk in the park compared to when I was a kid. This development was mainly acquired through continuous voluntary confrontation with the challenge (read that sentence again and emphasize voluntary). It was first when I understood that, or felt like, I volunteered, that I was able to compete with a free mind.

{{ lee }}

> Before I learned the art, a punch was just a punch, and a kick, just a kick. After I learned the art, a punch was no longer a punch, a kick, no longer a kick. Now that I understand the art, a punch is just a punch and a kick is just a kick.

> The height of cultivation is really nothing special. It is merely simplicity; the ability to express the utmost with the minimum.

{{ ava_routines }}

> Your job is to make sure the muse knows where to find you. In other words, consistency makes epiphanies possible. If you’re searching and you’re susceptible, you’ll be ready to receive inspiration when it comes.

> To put it another way: consistency is a way of paying attention. By showing up every day, you’re saying, hi, I’m here and I’m listening. I’m here and I’m trying. Carefully directed attention is the best way to solve any problem.

{{ cowen }}

> Recently, one of my favorite questions to bug people with has been “What is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?”  If you don’t know the answer to that one, maybe you are doing something wrong or not doing enough. Or maybe you are (optimally?) not very ambitious?

{{ luu_95 }}

> My belief is that it's easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there's so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities...

> One thing to note here is that it's important to actually track what you're doing and not just guess at what you're doing. When I've recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they're doing, these are often quite different.

{{ nielsen }}

> It is a tempting but ultimately counterproductive fallacy to believe that self-discipline is merely a matter of will, of deciding what it is that you want to do, and then doing it. Many other factors affect self-discipline, and it’s important to understand those other factors. Furthermore, if you believe that it’s all a matter of willpower then you’re likely to get rather depressed when you fall short, sapping your confidenc, and resulting in less disciplined behaviour.

> I now describe three factors important in achieving self-discipline.

> The first factor is having _clarity_ about _what_ one wants to achieve, _why_ one wants to achieve it, and _how_ to go about achieving it. It’s easy to work hard if you’re clear about these three things, and you’re excited about what you’re doing. Conversely, I think the main cause of aimlessness and procrastination is when you lack clarity on one or more of these points.

> The second factor affecting self-discipline is one’s social environment. Researchers are typically under little immediate social pressure to produce research results. Contrast this with the example of professional athletes, who often have an entire support system of coaches, managers and trainers in place, focused around the task of increasing their effectiveness. When a researcher stays out late, sleeps in, and gets a late start, no-one minds; when a professional athlete does, they’re likely to receive a blast from their coach.

> Access to a social environment which encourages and supports the development of research skills and research excellence can make an enormous difference to all aspect of one’s research, including self-discipline. The key is to be _accountable_ to other people. Some simple ways of achieving such accountability are to take on students, to collaborate with colleagues, or to set up mentoring relationships with colleagues.

> The third factor affecting self-discipline is a special kind of honesty, honesty to oneself, about oneself. It’s extremely easy to kid ourselves about what we do and who we are. A colleague once told me of a friend of his who for some time used a stopwatch to keep track of how much research work he did each week. He was shocked to discover that after factoring in all the other activities he engaged in each day – interruptions, email, surfing the net, the phone, fruitless meetings, chatting with friends, and so on – he was averaging only half an hour of research per day. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was typical of many researchers.

{{ deming }}

> Action comes before motivation. Learn to get work done even if you don’t feel like it at first. Find which actions lead to the flywheel of effects (positive reinforcement from others, successful completion of tasks you enjoy) that will motivate you to pursue a certain path. Carefully design systems for yourself. You may feel extreme motivation after watching the Social Network movie, but in the 11th hour get bored and tired of chasing down some abstract programming bug---you must ensure that, if there is an important goal you’d like to achieve, the clear-eyed version of yourself sets up a system to ensure that a later, less motivated of yourself will get it done.

{{ altman_successful }}

> You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot...

> Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.

{{ bronson }}

> Those who had been praised for their effort significantly improved on their first score—by about 30 percent. Those who’d been told they were smart did worse than they had at the very beginning—by about 20 percent.

> Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you think, ‘Man, this hurts, I can’t take it anymore. The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.

How Murakami convinced himself to put in the work,

> Another lesson to be learned, to continue using my oceanographic metaphor, is that while you are swimming and not sinking you should aim for rough water. When I was teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1960s, a student told me that he wanted to go into general relativity rather than the area I was working on, elementary particle physics, because the principles of the former were well known, while the latter seemed like a mess to him. It struck me that he had just given a perfectly good reason for doing the opposite. Particle physics was an area where creative work could still be done. It really was a mess in the 1960s, but since that time the work of many theoretical and experimental physicists has been able to sort it out, and put everything (well, almost everything) together in a beautiful theory known as the standard model. My advice is to go for the messes — that's where the action is.

{{ arkani-hamed1 }}

> Interviewer: Why haven't you written a popular [science] book?

> Arkani-Hamed: I think our real job is to push physics forward, and to try to learn something new about the way nature works, and that's a very tough business. It sounds obvious, but it really is a very tough business... I think it's conceivable that I might be able to make some really important impact, and push physics forward. It's not obvious. It's not completely obvious. And especially in a case like that, I think the only thing that's in our control, the only thing that is in my control, is single-minded, concentrated focus on the most important problem, the hardest problem, the most important problem that you have any hope of making some small progress on at any time, and the ability to concentrate and focus like that is absolutely crucial. My actual job is to try to figure out something about the way the world works, and I've been both blessed and cursed I think with just the right amount of talent, ability, motivation, to have a chance of doing it.

> Interviewer: Cursed because what? Because you feel you'd like 10 times more or-

> Arkani-Hamed: Well, I mean 10 times more would be fantastic. 10 times less it would be fairly clear that I couldn't do it, and it would also lead to a very different life... But it means that the aspect of this business, which is just flat-out hard work, is very important to me. It's very, very important, and it's the one thing that I feel is really in my control. If I didn't do that, I would sort of kick myself forever, for not having actually given everything I have to try to actually do the things which are really important. 

And some of his advice for working hard,

{{ arkani-hamed3 }}

> Einstein and Grothendieck and these people who managed to work solid on a problem for eight years. Trust me, you don't get up in the morning able to do that. The way you're able to work on a problem for eight years is you first manage to work on a problem for two months, three months, four months, a year. You have to exercise these muscles. You have to get good at it. You have to bite off as much as you can chew. And it's a hard balance, but you will know. You will know if you're honest with yourself---if what you're doing is just really easy and it's not challenging you at all, or if what you're doing is so hard that it's also not challenging you at all because you're not doing it. You have to find the perfect intermediate stage where you're in pain all the time. You're in pain all the time but it's a good kind of pain, because you're making a little bit of progress.

{{ einstein }}

> In light of knowledge attained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble. But the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alterations of confidence and exhaustion and the final emergence into the light---only those who have experienced it can understand it.

Einstein worked on relativity for eight years. Imagine the patience! I'd get concerned working on a project if nothing happened for six months.

{{ collison }}

> To the extent that you enjoy working hard, do. Subject to that constraint, it's not clear that the returns to effort ever diminish substantially. If you're lucky enough to enjoy it a lot, be grateful and take full advantage!

And,

> Find vivid examples of success in the domains you care about. If you want to become a great scientist, try to find ways to spend time with good (or, ideally, great) scientists in person. Watch YouTube videos of interviews. Follow some on Twitter.

## Fast fast fast cut cut cut

{{ kuhn }}

> There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don’t think that’s the main reason that speed is important...

> It’s worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren’t just about churning out work—they’re about processing information more quickly. The faster you process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next...

> That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast doesn’t just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output. Over time, that makes an enormous difference.

{{ ava_time }}

> I once read this great blogpost that used the analogy of keeping your inventory low. The author used inventory as an metaphor for things that you’re currently waiting on, the preconditions that need to be fulfilled before you act. For example, I want to hear about back this job before I apply for others. Or I need to lose weight before I wear this dress. Or, I need to have closure from my crush before I can move on and start dating other people. To be clear, sometimes the preconditions are real, but often they aren’t and you don’t actually need to wait for X to happen before you do Y. One way of keeping inventory low is to set self-imposed deadlines: if I don’t hear back in a week, I move on. Or you could just decide that the precondition doesn’t really matter.

{{ altman_email }}

> Years ago I wrote a little program to look at this, like how quickly our best founders---the founders that run billion-plus companies---answer my emails versus our bad founders. I don’t remember the exact data, but it was mind-blowingly different. It was a difference of minutes versus days on average response times.

{{ altman_successful }}

> I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.

Don’t delay a worthy sprint until after the next quarterly planning exercise. Design control and decisionmaking structures to bias heavily in favor of preserving operating cadence...

> A _stupendous_ portion of that advantage is just consistently choosing to get more done. That sounds vacuous but hasn’t been in my experience. I have seen truly silly improvements occasioned by someone just consistently asking in meetings “Could we do that faster? What is the minimum increment required to ship? Could that be done faster?” It’s the Charge More of management strategy; the upside is so dramatic, the cost so low, and the hit rate so high that you should just invoke it ritualistically.

> There are "phase changes" as you cross certain thresholds (details depend on the problem to some extent) where your entire way of working changes... There's a lot of things I could in theory do at any speed but in practice cannot, because as iteration time increases it first becomes so frustrating that I can't do it for long and eventually it takes so long that it literally drops out of my short-term memory, so I need to keep notes or otherwise organize it or I can't do it at all.

> Certainly if I can do an experiment in an interactive UI by dragging on a slider and see the result in a fraction of a second, at that point it's very "no filter", if you want to try something you just do it.

> Once you're at iteration times in the low seconds (say a compile-link cycle with a statically compiled lang) you don't just try stuff anymore, you also spend time thinking about whether it's gonna tell you anything because it takes long enough that you'd rather not waste a run.

> Once you get into several-minute or multi-hour iteration times there's a lot of planning to not waste runs, and context switching because you do other stuff while you wait, and note-taking/bookkeeping; also at this level mistakes are both more expensive (because a wasted run wastes more time) and more common (because your attention is so divided).

> As you scale that up even more you might now take significant resources for a noticeable amount of time and need to get that approved and budgeted, which takes its own meetings etc.

> If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.

> The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

Also, an aphorism I learned from college debate---"if you're writing, you're losing."

## But also work less hard and slow down

> Don’t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less happy).  Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head either.

> You also need to have the rest of your life in order to be an effective researcher. Make sure you’re fit. Look after your health. Spend high quality time with your family. Have fun. These things require a lot of thought and effort to get right. If you don’t get them right, not only will your life as a whole be less good, your research will suffer.

> You almost certainly can't consistently do the kind of work that demands serious mental focus for more than about three or four hours a day...

> The real lesson---or one of them---is that it pays to use whatever freedom you do have over your schedule not to "maximise your time" or "optimise your day", in some vague way, but specifically to ringfence three or four hours of undisturbed focus (ideally when your energy levels are highest). Stop assuming that the way to make progress on your most important projects is to work for longer... Just focus on protecting four hours – and don't worry if the rest of the day is characterised by the usual scattered chaos.

> Have fun with your friends. Go to the beach together at midnight, light a bonfire and talk about ideas. Camp and hike together. Share life stories. Bake cookies and watch movies in your living room under a fort like the ones you constructed as a kid. Build robots together, do chemistry experiments at home. Living with a great group can be truly exceptional.

> Creating meaning and value in life outside of the speed skating oval helped me get through tough training periods. When the training wasn’t going great, perhaps something else in life did and that cheered me up. Later on, when I became more successful and there was a media hype around me, the normal part of my life helped me keep myself grounded. I knew who I was and I was not just a speed skater. Today I’m very happy for all the friends I’ve made on all of those two rest days. Most of these friends are not speed skaters and to me they shed light upon my life from a new perspective. For that I am very thankful. I believe that it was the value I created outside of the sport, and not the success within it, that made it worthwhile to live in this manner; to face the horrific fact that only one of us will win the competition and all the others will lose; that injury or sickness can sabotage four years of work. It was not my success that justified my sacrifices, it was my friends, and I owed it to them to try to live up to my full potential.
