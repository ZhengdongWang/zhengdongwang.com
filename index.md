## What I'm doing now

* I'm a research engineer at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com) in London. My team works on generalization.

## Writing

* If you only read one thing, read this [readme](readme). It's like documentation, but about me!
* [Writing advice](writing) that has worked for me.
* [Productivity advice](productivity) that has worked for me, maybe.
* Rules for [picking classes at Yale](bluebook).
* Some more seasonal content. My website isn't sure if it's a website or a blog. ([All posts](blog), [RSS](/feed.xml)) {% for post in site.posts %}
  * {{ post.date | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }} \| [{{ post.title }}]({{post.url}})
{% endfor %}

## Research

* I contributed to [TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) in summer 2019 with the [X quantum team](https://x.company).
* I had an idea that turned into (but I didn't do most of the work for) a collaboration between Yale and ETH Zurich published in the Astrophysical Journal.
  * _GaMorNet: A Convolutional Neural Network to study morphology and quenching in SDSS and CANDELS_\
