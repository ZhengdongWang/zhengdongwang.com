I'm a Research Engineer at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com) in London. I work on assorted problems in reinforcement learning and large modeling. If you only read one thing, read this [readme](readme). It's like documentation, but about me.

Some seasonal content: {% for post in site.posts limit:5 %}
  * {{ post.date | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }} \| [{{ post.title }}]({{post.url}}) {% endfor %}
  * [All posts](blog), [RSS](/feed.xml).

More persistently, here are [quotes](quotes) I find beautiful, [writing advice](writing) that has worked for me, [productivity advice](productivity) that has worked for me (maybe), rules for [picking classes at Yale](bluebook), and the [colophon](about). I'm echoing [many](https://devonzuegel.com/page/contact) [other](https://danwang.co/contact) [people's](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation) standing invitations. I really like getting email.
