### What I'm doing now
* Summer!
* I'm an incoming research engineer at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) in London.
* In general, I'm interested in what artificial intelligence says about human intelligence&mdash;and eventually, about what's going on with this whole existence thing.

### Writing
* If you only read one thing, this [readme](readme2) talks about things that have influenced me and things I recommend. It's like documentation, but about me.
* Here are the rules I set for myself for [picking classes at Yale](bluebook). They have made my academic life much easier.
* [Writing advice](writing) I've received. It's not well written itself.
* My "Silicon Valley self-help" style [productivity notes](productivity).

### Projects
* I contributed to [TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) the summer before its release with the Quantum@X and Google AI quantum teams.
* I had an idea that evolved into (but I didn't do most of the work for) [this](http://www.astro.yale.edu/aghosh/gamornet.html) collaboration between Yale and ETH Z&uuml;rich, published in The Astrophysical Journal.
