# About

As promised, here are some fun facts about this website:
* In light mode, the background color is [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte), the average color of the universe. In dark mode, the background color is a really dark blue I picked out a long time ago. If you're curious it's #000226.
* The font is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato), by [Lukasz Dziedzic](http://www.lukaszdziedzic.eu).
* I use [tsParticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles) by Matteo Bruni for the background particles.
* This website is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It used to be generated with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and hosted with [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
* If you're a robot that scrapes email, here's another one for you! [uce@ftc.gov](mailto:uce@ftc.gov)
* This site uses Google Analytics. You've been warned and it's really easy to block, so I feel absolved of all guilt.
