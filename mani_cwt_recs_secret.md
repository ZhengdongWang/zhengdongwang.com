## Topics ZD likes (but not sure if you do), guests who are good at being interviewed too

## Conservatives (very interesting episodes!!)

These would be in the above section too, but there are enough of these guys to get their own section.

## Chaotic, Tyler or guest argues, fun

This section would also include David Deustch (above).

{% include apple_podcast.html id='https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/camille-paglia-on-her-lifestyle-of-observation-live/id983795625?i=1000367489861' %}

Srinivasan is a good contrast to Paglia (above) because Srinivasan is very woke by today's standards and Paglia is very not.
