title: What I listened to this year

I listened to more singles and fewer albums compared to previous years. Part of it was because of travel, where I would hear something like [Pasoori](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lvDsmTRXFE3dK4OjvRiWB?si=2b875005aaac43b7) and [可能](https://open.spotify.com/track/1jtLQkWGdK0hrjSwfa9YIb?si=5ea3418f04e44fde), go down a rabbit hole, and listen to the tree of songs that grew from there to death. Another part of it was because I listened to more pop, old and new releases, and I think they're fine with me not liking the whole album. Another change is I no longer religiously listen to Discover Weekly and Release Radar anymore. The reason is a combination of feeling like it's getting slightly worse, trying to be less of a completionist generally, and because I got so much mileage out of reading [Concrete Avalanche](https://jakenewby.substack.com/) and [AnyDecentMusic?](http://anydecentmusic.com/). So many of the below albums I first heard there, and I think that will continue. Lana Del Rey was not in my Spotify Wrapped top 5 artists for the first time ever. But I found Jingfei Chen, who is like Lana but in Mandarin.

Finally, this year we welcome [爱情绣瓜](https://open.spotify.com/track/52w9B0m3A0cNrfHAgyaGqZ?si=38369df421994ff5) to These Songs Do Not Have Flaws and [Biała flaga](https://open.spotify.com/album/5pba4FjOiX0lPgJfthxBiC?si=cS5heHriTmSnoAEjWcQhqw) to These Albums Do Not Have Flaws.
