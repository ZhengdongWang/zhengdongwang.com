I bought my own groceries last summer and the summer before. When I bought bananas, I'd remember to eat them. It's like a banana timer appeared in the back of my mind. If I don't eat at least one banana every two days, the bunch will go bad before I finish, I would tell myself.

I think my mom does the same thing when she buys bananas. But because I'm home, she's adjusted her banana-buying habits to account. She buys more bananas than she eats and only feels responsible for eating a third of the bananas she buys.

But because I didn't buy any bananas, I don't feel responsible for eating any! There was no catalyst to set off my banana timer. I don't feel like I'm forgetting anything if I don't eat bananas for two days. Yesterday I saw a banana and thought, oh hey, I'll eat one just for fun. A one-time thing. My subconscious is operating on banana-bonus mode and not banana-schedule mode.

All this means my family is operating at about a two-banana-per-bunch inefficiency right now. My mom buys more bananas expecting me to eat some. I eat less than some because I don't expect myself to eat any. Tragique.
