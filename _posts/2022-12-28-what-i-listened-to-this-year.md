Albums that I liked more than enough, that I came back to (I didn't listen them to death the first time), that have no bad songs on them (so you can listen to them without skipping), that you might not have also listened to this year. There were songs I listened to a lot not on this list because their albums didn't have all of the above criteria.

According to Spotify, Bakunda Ulu was my most played song this year.

I also finally got to see Max Richter's Four Seasons Recomposed, S&#333; Percussion, Caroline Shaw, and Anna Lapwood / The Pembroke Choirs in concert.
