Alright guys let me tell you about my favorite YouTube channel of all time. It's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0m_Ah8P_MQbnn77-vYnYw'>Gourmet Chef Wang Gang</a>. Apparently he is pretty famous in China but only people like my parents know about him here. He teaches you how to make Chinese dishes, like a Binging with Babish for Chinese food. Babish is fine, but he's got nothing on Wang Gang.

<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOtheXhqOAI'>This</a> is him making my favorite Chinese dish ever. His videos are 4K quality! He chops things on a tree stump! And he fills in free time with the history of the dish and how to pick the vegetables at the store! His knife work is oddly soothing to watch. And so is when he tosses the wok, all things I definitely can't do even if I practiced. Recently his videos are outside surrounded by nice green scenery. You can watch his family eat afterwards.

But that's not all! Sometimes his videos are in his kitchen inside, and they are so efficient. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USoC8AqirVA'>Here</a> is his tutorial for Mapo Tofu. Subtitles! Summary at the end! Crisp editing! No wasted time! Did I mention so efficient?

And if you like slower-paced content <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0N0a9QRDkU'>here</a> is him cooking for his daughter's fifth birthday. With cute pictures and everybody wearing matching t-shirts. One of his catchphrases according to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Gang_(chef)'>his Wikipedia page</a> is literally "hot the pot." This man can do no wrong.
