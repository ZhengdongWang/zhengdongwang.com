All from [this article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-matters-so-much-20211203/).

On Hubble's launch,

> The primary mirror — the big, concave one that bounced light to a secondary mirror that then reflected it onto a camera lens — had not been ground down to quite the right concavity to focus the light; it was half a wavelength too thick around the edge.

> Some NASA leaders called for abandoning the telescope, which was already a controversial project. Instead, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland secured the funds for a rescue mission.

Another big win for an already cool senator and state.

> One of the Hubble telescope’s most impactful discoveries, and a major impetus for building its successor, the Webb, occurred in 1995, two years after its corrective lens was installed. Bob Williams, then the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, the operations center for Hubble as it will be for Webb, decided at the suggestion of some postdocs to devote all 100 hours of his “director’s discretionary time,” with which he could point Hubble wherever he wanted, to pointing it at nothing — a dark, featureless little patch of sky narrower than a thumbnail moon.

I didn't know that I should be thanking some postdocs for one of my wallpapers for the past few years. [This link](https://www.nasa.gov/content/discoveries-hubbles-deep-fields) says director's discretionary time was 10 percent of Hubble's observation time, which sounds really high.

Ok on Webb,

> For an IR telescope to be as sensitive as Hubble, which has a 2.4-meter-wide primary mirror, Illingworth, Bely and Stockman realized that it would need to be significantly bigger, since it detects bigger wavelengths. They considered that the mirror might have to fold to fit in a rocket. They also knew it had to be cold, otherwise its heat would saturate its own sensors. Rather than actively cool the telescope, they thought to exploit the extreme frigidity of outer space by blocking the heat of the Earth, moon and sun. Their vague conception of a large, passively cooled infrared telescope, greatly elaborated upon, would become the cargo now awaiting launch in Kourou.

> Ball Aerospace delivered actuators capable of nudging each of the gold hexagons in 10-nanometer increments, one ten-thousandth the width of a hair.

> On a recent Zoom call, Menzel bent his arm back and forth at the elbow to explain the challenge presented by the sunshield. “If you take something rigid, like a door, and you build a nice hinge, you can predict the way that moves,” he said. “That’s a piece of cake.” He stopped bending his arm. “Now you got blankets. They’re floppy. Try to push on a blanket on your bed and predict the shape that it’s going to go in. It’s horrible. Same thing with a string — the strings that tension [the sunshield]. There’s a million different ways that a string can move.” It gets worse: “Now put all this experience in zero-G, where that stuff can go in places you just don’t want it to go.” Smoothly unfolding the sunshield “becomes a very tough problem.”

> Around 2004, the NASA engineers Chuck Perrygo and Keith Parrish came into Menzel’s office at Goddard and said they had a way to do it. Perrygo picked up a piece of paper on Menzel’s desk and folded it into the shape of a Z. The sunshield could be folded into many more such zigzags, in what’s sometimes called an accordion fold.

> The next question was how to hold the accordion fold in place until the sunshield was ready to unfurl. A Northrop Grumman engineer, Andy Tao, found the solution: 107 pins that retract like a cat’s claws.

> The pin approach sprouted another tricky problem: pins make pinholes. If, after unfurling, pinholes on all five Kapton layers were to line up, this would let a sunbeam through, heating the optics. “It was one of those arcane little details that you’d never guess until you start getting into it and you start finding out, ah, Christ, five of the pinholes are lining right up and that’s going to let sunlight right in,” Menzel said. “It doesn’t sound like much, but it was driving Andy to drink. And God bless him, he figured it out.” Tao diligently sought out a suitable configuration of pins so that the holes in the five slightly-different-size Kapton layers would never align from any angle.

There really are no rules if you're crazy enough. It's like [this Argo scene](https://youtu.be/8uHdjQp8v80?t=160). You need a mirror, a mirror that's actually way bigger than Hubble's... that fits in a fairing... and can stay really cold... and is lightweight... that works on the first try.

> The telescope is 14 years behind schedule and 20 times over budget.

> Back in 1996, Mather and his team estimated that the telescope would cost $564 million — a somewhat disingenuous guess aimed at getting Congress on board — and that it would launch in 2007.

Ok fair we shouldn't scare Congress. So we're not that behind a reasonable schedule and budget right?

> In 2011, JWST was nearly canceled, but elementary school students wrote letters to Washington and Senator Mikulski again came to NASA’s rescue.

God bless.

> And in 2017 and 2018, these tests turned up one problem after another. 

> After a “shake test,” a bunch of screws and washers that had held the sunshield cover in place were found on the floor; they hadn’t been properly torqued.

I remember this. The image of pieces literally falling off the telescope 11 years after the original launch date sharply and comically confirmed how far government had slipped. A lot of people in the Yale astronomy department had a drink when NASA delayed the launch from my first year to my junior year.

> The telescope got in another scrape when it was shipped to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, placed in the chamber where Apollo astronauts once practiced their moonwalks, and cryogenically cooled to simulate the conditions of outer space. While instrument builders like Sarah Kendrew were testing the cold hardware, Hurricane Harvey hit. The whole city catastrophically flooded, but the biggest worry for the Webb team was the liquid nitrogen supply. If it ran out, the telescope’s temperature would rise too quickly, damaging the instruments. The liquid nitrogen suppliers had to be urged to send trucks through the floodwaters as a matter of national importance.

Who would be able to resist succumbing to sunk cost when the sunk cost is this high?

> Webb’s final cost approaches $10 billion. That’s nearly 20 times its sticker price, but still a few billion less than an aircraft carrier.

As of this writing, there are two Gerald R. Ford–class aircraft carriers (each $13 billion) under construction for a total of 10 planned.

> In September, the telescope passed a final test in Redondo Beach: Gold ears pinned back and blanket stashed away, the whole observatory was turned on its side, then righted, then checked to see whether anything had changed. Then it was put back on its side into a shipping container and taken away.

> The exact date of the shipping container’s departure from California was kept quiet — a precaution against piracy on the high seas.

Free container ship fact thrown in.

> Last year, more than 2,000 groups submitted proposals to use JWST in the first cycle; a time allocation committee selected 266.

I wonder if they redid this time allocation every time launch was a year away? How many of these things were written over a decade ago?

The article has much more about various observing proposals that I skipped over.

> “It will be our own ‘dare mighty things’ moment,” said Grant Tremblay, an astrophysicist at Harvard University who served on the telescope’s time allocation committee. “It’s going to do amazing things. We’ll be in The New York Times talking about how this is witnessing the birth of stars at the edge of time, this is one of the earliest galaxies, this is the story of other Earths.” 

> “Please work,” Tremblay added, his eyes fluttering upward.

Which is all I want for Christmas.
