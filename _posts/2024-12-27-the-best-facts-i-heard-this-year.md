I love reading other people's annual fact lists, so I decided to shamelessly steal the idea. These are the best facts I heard this year, the best on the day that I heard it (though it might not have been a recently created fact). So yes, there were some really competitive days where some other really good facts lost and so are lost to me, as well as long stretches where no fact passed muster.

January 13. The bannister of the grand staircase in the Royal Opera House was built for Queen Victoria's height. [via B.](https://www.instagram.com/royalballetandopera/reel/C95GEtcNm56/) I couldn't find a source for exactly this online---perhaps they tell you on the tour?

January 19. The USDA definition of a hot dog requires that they be comminuted (reduced to minute particles), semisolid products made from one or more kinds of raw skeletal muscle from livestock.

May 20. A bunch of Portland, Maine facts while I was visiting, all too good to choose one. Portland, Maine has the most restaurants per capita in America. The 9/11 attackers chose Portland Maine to take off from because the security was more lax. They stayed in a nearby Comfort Inn, that to this day hangs a plaque commemorating that fact. (Okay this next one is Vinalhaven, not Portland.) A new guy moved to Vinalhaven, a lobstering island, allegedly won a lobstering job over another guy, who also had a daughter with a cousin of the second guy's wife, and so the second guy killed the first guy with an axe, but allegedly in self defense, and nobody was charged. "We call you, you come out, nothing fucking happens. That is why vigilantes and Vinalhaven [island justice](https://www.mysteryscenemag.com/article/7694-michael-koryta-on-island-justice) is the way we do shit."

May 31. We might imagine the forbidden fruit as an apple because of a typo. In Latin, the words for "evil" and "apple" are both "malum," so a scribe could easily have copied "the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil" ("boni et mali") with apples. Michelangelo depicts the fruit as a fig. [via J.](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/13/opinion/l-michelangelo-s-forbidden-fruit-was-a-fig-475389.html)

June 8. "About a year later, an Italian journalist leaked to the US Embassy in Rome a purported Nigerien government document detailing the purchase. Fingar showed the document to an INR analyst who had served as a foreign service officer in Niger. "He looked at the putative document and he says, 'That's a forgery. It's an obvious forgery,'" Fingar says. "How do you know it's an obvious forgery? 'In Niger, when they sign, the line is on a diagonal. This is horizontal. It's obviously not an official document.'""

June 21. "The 21-metre rule is, according to the Stirling prize-winning architect Annalie Riches, a bizarre hangover from 1902, originally intended to protect the modesty of Edwardian women. The urban designers Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker walked apart in a field until they could no longer see each other’s nipples through their shirts. The two men measured the distance between them to be 70ft (21 metres), and this became the distance that is still used today, 120 years later, to dictate how far apart many British homes should be built."

August 19. In the UK, parties are legally bound as soon as the letter accepting the offer is posted, regardless of whether the letter is later received.

October 6. "Trial by boiling water was not as bad as it sounded. In medieval Europe, those accused of grave crimes might be ordered to plunge an arm into a bubbling cauldron to retrieve an object. If they were scalded, that was God’s way of revealing their guilt. The chance of acquittal would seem to be zero, but 60% of those who underwent this ordeal got off. How come? The answer is that defendants believed in divine judgment. The guilty, convinced that God knew all, confessed to avoid the extra punishment of scalding. The innocent assumed they would be acquitted, so they refused to confess. The priests who prepared the cauldron knew this, and did not want to undermine their own authority by condemning someone who might later prove innocent. So they did not heat the water as much as they pretended to." [via _The Economist_.](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/10/04/how-humans-invented-good-and-evil-and-may-reinvent-both)

December 8. "My friend Paul's mother was the daughter of Canadian missionaries, and she spent her childhood in Sichuan. During the upheavals of early Republican China, she and her family made occasional trips back to Canada, and had to brave pirates on their way down the Yangtze River to Shanghai. Apparently, the joke was that the pirates, lurking in the backwaters, sent spies to watch the passengers on board as they dined, because observing how an individual ate their fish would give them a good idea of the kind of ransom they might fetch. Anyone who preferred the grapplesome area around the head showed the exquisite taste of the upper classes and was certainly worth kidnapping. Those who favoured the muscly flesh near the tail of the fish might fetch a 800d price, while anyone who ate their fish willy-nilly, careless of the distinctions of texture, might as well be tossed overboard." [via F.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123979561-invitation-to-a-banquet)

December 9. When Barshu, arguably the first premium Sichuan restaurant in London, opened, they consulted Fuschia Dunlop to choose and translate the menu.
