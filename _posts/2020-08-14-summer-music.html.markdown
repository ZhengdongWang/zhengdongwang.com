My internship this summer involved coding for many hours a day, and to make it more interesting I usually play music when I code. But I ran out of music really fast, and finding new music every day became a chore. At some point I outsourced finding new music to just going down the list of <a href='http://tedgioia.com/'>Ted Gioia's</a> top 100 albums list every year. I don't know anything about music, so whatever bias he has, it's still way better than me picking.

My internship ends today, and I listened to his top 100 lists from 2019 to the middle of 2015, skipping what I didn't like the beginning of (and actually skipping less as time went on). I don't remember most of what I listened to, since I was coding through most of it. But here are my favorites, which I slowly had to realized I liked as I was doing something else, which honestly is not a great system, and not easy! They're kind of ordered by year.

Spin Cycle, Afiara Quartet, Skratch Bastid, 2015

I'm sure there's more, but they've all blended together. In 2019 he also has Norman Fucking Rockwell and When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? on his list, both of which I like but you've probably heard already.
