They say singing "Happy Birthday" twice while washing your hands will get you to twenty seconds.

I started reciting the fear litany from <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune'>Dune</a>, which seemed more relevant.

<blockquote>
  "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
</blockquote>
