Spotify Wrapped assigned me Taipei.

I can't wait for Lana's "album of standards---classic, simple songs that could reach even more people than she does now. A bit like the gorgeous, piano-led cover of Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver that she released on Friday, or the Elvis Presley version of Unchained Melody that she recorded at Graceland for a Christmas TV show." In [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lana-del-rey-ive-been-on-my-guard-for-so-long-5qq2shmqr).

This year we welcome [Don't Dream It's Over](https://open.spotify.com/track/7G7tgVYORlDuVprcYHuFJh?si=9edf0ec9bee544df) and [Paint The Town Red](https://open.spotify.com/track/7DlZH8EiVDgQXNoj3dnyZC?si=242a2ef052694383) to [These Songs Do Not Have Flaws](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6CFotAZGG30wEw8q5ktupa).
