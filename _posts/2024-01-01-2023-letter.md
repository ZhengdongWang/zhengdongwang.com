Research engineers, like other human beings, have five senses.

The first and most important sense is touch. Touch tells the edges of a good abstraction. Computer engineers find this intuitive. From Dijkstra we have "Separation of Concerns." Distinct components of a system should handle distinct concerns. From others, Don't Repeat Yourself, You Ain't Gonna Need It, Keep It Simple, Stupid, and so on. I don't think it's controversial to say that all engineering really is, is creating the *perfect abstraction*.

The end of the year is a time for imagination and polemic. So take this to a further extreme. The act of research---no, all intelligent behavior---is about the perfect abstraction. Dijkstra said as much. Separation of Concerns is from his essay "[On the role of scientific thought](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html)." In it he explained "what to [his] taste is characteristic of all intelligent thinking."

So let me give a flavor of the problems of distinction that research engineers face. Then, I will propose an abstraction that I cannot describe in any way except *perfect*.

Everybody knows the distinction between supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, a model learns to map inputs to outputs based on labeled data. In reinforcement learning, the model acts in an environment to get feedback in the form of rewards. But this simple starting point immediately leads to a fork. Offline reinforcement learning, where we fix the dataset, blurs the lines. One could give up the distinction---at the end of the day, all is just data, in a format, shoved through a function, running on a device. With online environment interactions batched as offline data, neither optimizer dot step nor the TPU is any the wiser.

Or we can decompose further. The current paradigm has a further distinction: [pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g). It turns out, as in a human life, it matters when and how many times one reads Wikipedia or reddit. The distinction helps. If we begot helpful assistants from one big, streamed, naively mixed pot of data, that would be a big result indeed.

The distinction between train and test seems to be an important one. Some public models regurgitate their test set, and nobody bats an eye. But when I go and train on test, everybody loses their minds. Just kidding, don't do that. But what if we jettisoned this distinction? As you know, in the infinite data regime, train loss is test loss. [Transformers fail to generalize to simple extrapolation tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00871) No problem, just redefine the training distribution. I'm tired of writing separate evaluation codepaths, and want to delete them.

Then there is research engineer, the job title. I traced the etymology of the term. I found scattered uses in government, academia, and General Motors a decade ago. It's everywhere now, in no small part to AI. Shane Legg hired DeepMind's first research engineer in 2014 to distinguish beyond research scientist and software engineer. (That and [the other term](https://goertzel.org/who-coined-the-term-agi/) he coined engages much of my attention.) I suppose time will see the rise the monolithic "member of technical staff."

A saying I enjoy misapplying: the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Research engineers, in possession of one set of tradeoffs, will long for another. Implementing the hackneyed programming principles I started off with is the source of its discontents. Should we have one codebase each for pre-training, fine-tuning, and RLHF? Better distinguish three teams, each responsible for one. Even better, let's put them in different buildings while we're at it. Or, actually everyone should be familiar with the entire stack, so let's cut the bureaucracy. One framework to rule them all, with a couple of if statements in the surely few cases the logic differs. Just one more if statement bro, bro i swear, just one more if statement and we'll support all the cases you wanna support bro.

Finally, there is this distinction of artificial general intelligence itself. Ever more research engineers are working towards this goal. If we have trouble defining the abstraction of our own codebases, what hope do we have of defining our research program?

Most research engineers seem to think it is something we can define, if only because they don't think we've gotten there yet. Last year one claimed to see sentience. This March a whole author list [saw sparks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712). And our biggest reason to believe that we'll be able to distinguish it---for how else will OpenAI's board of directors know when to deprive Microsoft of its licenses and shareholder value?

I'm not here just to tease. As usual, I save my most candid critique for dear colleagues.

Artificial intelligence has long been plagued with defining the very thing it is trying to build. The more specific the definition, the more criticism it gets. Nobody seems to be happy with the Turing Test, for one; it's the first dead horse to ritualistically beat to join the conversation. People also complain that other definitions are hard to measure, or don't measure what we want to measure.

The latest entrant in this crowded field goes one step meta. Instead of defining AGI, [Morris et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02462) introduce an "ontology of AGI" in November: "six principles [they] believe are necessary for a clear, operationalizable definition of AGI." A definition of definitions, if you will. How does one "operationalize progress" towards AGI without wading into the mire of specific instantiations? It seems difficult. Take the principle that Morris et al. build their eponymous Levels around: AGI definitions ought focus on performance and generality.

They define performance as a machine's skill relative to skilled humans it can outperform. A machine at the 50th percentile of skilled humans is "competent," while one that outperforms all humans is "superhuman." They correctly point out that they do not have to define the tasks. But for the ontology to avoid passing on all the work to the underlying definition of AGI, they must make some commitments.

What is a skilled human? They say: "a sample of adults who possess the relevant skill." I take this to mean: skilled humans are humans who have the skill we would like them to have that would make them a good test for this definition of AGI.

What kind of tasks should definitions benchmark on? "We emphasize here the importance of choosing tasks that align with real-world (i.e., ecologically valid) tasks that people value (construing "value" broadly, not only as economic value but also social value, artistic value, etc.)." So tasks that people value, in a broad sense.

How many tasks, to be general? In a footnote: "We hesitate to specify the precise number or percentage of tasks that a system must pass at a given level of performance in order to be declared a General AI at that Level... it will probably not be 100%, since it seems clear that broad but imperfect generality is impactful... Determining what portion of benchmarking tasks at a given level demonstrate generality remains an open research question." The number of tasks a machine must pass to be general is the number of tasks we agree would be appropriate.

And what is generality? "Generality refers to the breadth of an AI system's capabilities, i.e., the range of tasks for which an AI system reaches a target performance threshold."

There's a pattern here. Spinoza scholar [Michael Della Rocca described it best](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-parmenidean-ascent-9780197510940) (choice nouns replaced by yours truly):

> If we have learned one thing from the early modern critique of Aristotelian explanations, it is that a mere appeal to the nature of a thing without saying how this nature does what it does is an explanation that is indeed empty and unilluminating...

> Another, perhaps even more general way to characterize the fundamental worry here and to caricature Aristotelian explanation by substantial forms anew is to invoke---of all personages---the figure of John Wayne. The emptiness or unilluminatingness that Aristotelian explanations by substantial forms are alleged to have is perhaps like a kind of emptiness or unilluminatingness that is also found, perhaps in the iconic statement---problematic in so many ways---sometimes attributed to John Wayne and often repeated as a kind of parody: "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do." This statement is most likely not intended, of course, as an account or explanation of any kind. In saying what he does, Wayne (or the Wayne character or the parody of the Wayne character) may be attempting to demonstrate what a man's gotta do or to embody in his laconic directness what a man's gotta do. But, if intended as an account of what a man's gotta do, this statement would be empty, uninformative, and unilluminating. Similarly, on the simple account of [AGI] just offered, [AGI] has gotta be what [AGI] has gotta be. Adopting such a circular, uninformative account is what I call a John Wayne moment.

A skilled human's gotta be what a skilled human's gotta be. Value's gotta measure what value's gotta measure. The right number of tasks is the right number of tasks. Generality's gotta be what generality's gotta be. The John Wayne moments of the AGI research program.

I've nitpicked Morris et al. flippantly and uncharitably (apologies). (I plead, it's a holiday blog post, not a peer-reviewed rebuttal.) But I think these statements indicate a wider ambiguity in the entire project of AGI. Similar statements in other formulations, some even canonical definitions, fare no better, as we will see. AGI is a concept intertwined with our basic beliefs about ourselves and what we find valuable. A few levels of explanation won't do. In answering what an intelligent agent ought to be, I can't blame you for, like a small child, asking why over and over.

We can be grateful, then, that this confusion is not unique even to the project of AGI. It's a problem with the project of creating abstractions in general.

Michael Della Rocca, ostensibly a serious Spinoza scholar, moonlights as a skeptical evangelist. In [that whole book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-parmenidean-ascent-9780197510940) he goes door to door to philosophy's most established theories of substance, action, knowledge, meaning, and metaphysical explanation. He blithely accuses these fundamental concepts of all ending up at the unilluminating Agrippan Trilemma. I'll let Gemini tell it:

> The Agrippan trilemma is a philosophical thought experiment that challenges the possibility of establishing absolute certainty for any belief or knowledge claim. It states that any attempt inevitably falls into one of three problems:

> 1. Infinite regress: This occurs when the justification for a belief relies on another belief, which itself requires justification, and so on ad infinitum. This endless chain of justifications ultimately fails to provide a final, absolute foundation for any belief.
> 2. Circular reasoning: This happens when a belief is used to justify itself or a set of beliefs that ultimately rely on it. This creates a closed loop where the belief is both the premise and the conclusion, offering no external validation.
> 3. Dogmatism: This involves accepting some beliefs without any justification at all. While seemingly straightforward, it raises questions about the reliability and objectivity of such beliefs, especially if they contradict other seemingly well-founded claims.

Fortunately, Della Rocca revisits the foundations of philosophy, and patches them up again good as new with one simple trick. Better than new---he uses the aforementioned *perfect abstraction*, no less. Shall we see if his tried and true formula can help us, too, here in the AGI project? I will quote him liberally; I'm sure he meant to say AGI, anyway. We start by showing that:

> ...the investigation of a key phenomenon [AGI] is driven by an explanatory demand: what is it in virtue of which instances of this phenomenon [AGI] are 
instances of this phenomenon [AGI]?

We then:

> ...support the claim about the prevalence of the explanatory demand with regard to [AGI] by highlighting some pithy and telling quotes from leading theorists.

Turing, Searle, various authors mentioned above, various research labs, the tweeting intelligentsia. Evidence of the explanatory demand for AGI is everywhere.

> ...representative theories in this field all fail to meet---perhaps inevitably fail to meet---this explanatory demand which they impose on themselves or at least to which they are committed. As above, critiquing a definition of definitions has the added benefit of exposing the unilluminatingness of all definitions, in some way or another.

This one is also easy. The lack of consensus around one definition of AGI is all you need to know. But here are some choice questions, if you must.

In virtue of what, is [winning the imitation game](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf) an instance of AGI?

In virtue of what, is a computer that when [given right programs can literally be said to understand and have cognitive states](https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf) an instance of AGI? 

In virtue of what, are [environment boundaries, or collections of computable environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329), a measure of AGI? 

In virtue of what, is a [highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work](https://openai.com/our-structure) an instance of AGI?

These questions will lead to the Trilemma. Here my quoting pen goes into overdrive. (I will literally just change some nouns.) Feel free to skim this next part if you buy the broader point. I'm also exercising a normal research engineering skill---copying and pasting generally useful codepaths. It's an `import mdr` followed by an `mdr.parm_ascend('agi')`.

Consider a superintelligent machine, S, and the AGI-explaining-or-making relation, R. There are four exhaustive and mutually exclusive options.

> (1) R is primitive. That is, the relation, R, between S and some items is not grounded in or explained by anything. There is nothing in virtue of which S stands in R to these items.

> (2) R is not primitive, but is, rather, ultimately grounded in or explained by or ultimately holds, at least in part, in virtue of a relation to something other than S.

> (3) R is not primitive, but is, rather, ultimately grounded in or explained by or ultimately holds in virtue of the nature of S alone. That is, it follows from the nature of S alone that S is [an AGI]. R is thus, in one sense of the term, an internal relation, a relation that stems simply from the nature of a thing.

> (4) R is not primitive, but also is not ultimately grounded (as in (2) and (3)); instead, R is grounded in other items in a non-terminating regress or in a circle with a multiplicity of items.

Option (1) and (4) outright refuses to meet the explanatory demand. Let's discard them. It's unsatisfying to state, for example, that it's just a brute fact that the imitation game defines an AGI. Doing so betrays our explanatory commitment as scientists. And it's just as unsatisfying to never arrive, stuck in an infinite regress or a circular proof.

> In so ruling out (1), I am committed to a key principle that will in fact drive the rest of the argument: a relation must obtain in virtue of some thing or things. That is, relations are grounded in things that serve as their metaphysical explanation. On this view, relations need to be made intelligible, and they are made so in terms of their grounds...

> Let's take option (2) next. According to this option, the [AGI]-making relation is not free-floating but rather is grounded, at least in part, in certain items other than S.

We can find such an account in, for example, Legg and Marcus's view that the environments a machine can solve defines its AGI status, or in OpenAI's view that AGI status depends on what other human and artificial intelligences value.

> However, while the lack of an explanation of R offered by a proponent of option (1) is immediately unsatisfactory in this context, an explanation that a proponent of option (2) offers is ultimately unsatisfactory... R---the [AGI]-making relation---grounded in part in S and in part in the other relatum or relata, it is also grounded in part in a further relation between, e.g., S and R itself...

> Relations are not, as I indicated in eliminating option (1), free-floating. Rather, they are, by their nature, dependent at least on their relata... the relation by its nature demands not only that its relata be in place, but---because a relation is by its nature dependent on its relata---the relation also demands that there be a relation of partial grounding between the relation and each relatum individually...

> Call this relation of grounding, R'. Thus, R depends not only on its relata, but also on R' (the relation of grounding between R and one of its relata). So R' is the relation of grounding between R and S...

> Given that R depends in part on R', in asking what the [AGI]-making relation, R, depends on, we are led to ask: in virtue of what does the relation, R', of partial grounding between R and S hold? Because R' is more fundamental than R, R' is more genuinely the [AGI]-making relation. This point concerns a metaphysical dependence relation between R' and other items. There is also a parallel epistemological point: we cannot be said to have fully understood the [AGI]-making relation, R, until we understand in what it is grounded, and so we cannot understand R until we understand R'. Thus, we cannot fully understand R until we understand on what R' is grounded. 

> So we ask: on what is R' grounded? Well, R' is a relation (of partial grounding) between S and R and, as such, it depends not only on S and on R but also on a relation of partial grounding between S and R' itself... Call the relation of partial grounding between R' and S, R''---i.e. R double prime. Notice that in order to metaphysically explain R and thus in order to metaphysically explain R', it now turns out that we must metaphysically explain R'', and so on ad infinitum.

Option (2), is, in the end, a vicious regress.

> Let's turn now to option (3), the only remaining option. On this view, the [AGI]-making relation, R, that S stands in is not primitive, nor does S stand in this relation because of some other thing. Instead, this relation is ultimately grounded in S's nature alone.

We find this account in Searle and others that define AGI according to the machine's internal processes.

> It might be thought that the situation would look brighter for option (3) than for option (2) because, with (3), R is grounded in the nature of S alone. Here there is no other relatum external to or independent of S, and so we don't have to appeal to any perhaps problematic notion of partial grounding in the way that we had to with option (2).

> However, even with option (3), we have to appeal to a further relation in spelling out the grounds of relation R. If we don't appeal to a further relation as a ground of R, if we just say that R is grounded in S's nature and leave things at that, then we will be saying that S stands in the [AGI]-making relation R simply because that is the nature of S. But... if we've learned one thing from the early modern critique of Aristotelian explanations, it's that mere appeals to natures are not explanatorily illuminating. So if we are to preserve option (3), we need to say not just that R is grounded in S's nature alone, but we also need to say how it is grounded in S's nature alone...

> So we need to specify how the [AGI]-making relation R is grounded in S alone. But this "how" points to the fact that we need to specify another relation---call it R* ---in virtue of which R is grounded in S alone. In other words, we are now seeking a relation R* which is the relation of grounding between S and R. Since R* is thus more fundamental than R, R* turns out to be---more genuinely than R itself---the [AGI]-making relation. And thus of this [AGI]-making relation we are naturally led to ask: what is R* grounded in? 

Alas, regress again, vicious. He also does the punchline:

> This is a failure that mirrors the massive and general failure of the historically prominent theories of [AGI] that we surveyed... We seem then to be in the grips of a version of the ancient Agrippan Trilemma: in attempting to give an account of [AGI] either we make a dogmatic claim (this would be option (1) where we treat the [AGI]-making relation as primitive), or we are faced with an vicious regress (option (2)), or we are faced with an unilluminating explanatory circle (option (3)).

> The notion of [AGI] that I have rejected as incoherent is the notion common to [Turing, Searle] and many others. It is the notion of [an AGI] as distinct somehow from other items, [AGI] as differentiated either from its states or parts (if any)... Or it is at least the notion of [AGI] as related to some thing or things. Or, again, it is the notion of [an AGI] that stands in an internal relation to its nature. 

The problem, as we now see, is relations. The perfect abstraction is one with no distinctions at all. 

> With this abandonment of any distinctions, Parmenides makes what I call in his honor, the Parmenidean Ascent: he rejects distinctions as unintelligible or even non-thinkable, and he advances to a view that does not posit any distinctions. There is no loss of reality---no failure to explain something real---when Parmenides makes the Parmenidean Ascent. Indeed, there is a gain because with this ascent Parmenides sees the world aright. Parmenides' extreme monistic view is thus far richer than we might have thought, for, by getting rid of distinctions, Parmenides is no longer encumbered by unintelligibility or is, at least, less encumbered.

In this monist view, there are no distinctions. There are no classes, no categories, no "is AGI" and "is not AGI." (There is not even one AGI. That's because counting presupposes relations between numbers. So we must also reject counting.) But even if there are no differentiated intelligences or no being differentiated from its states or parts, we may still have undifferentiated, unrelated artificial general intelligence.

In this way, the term AGI is something like a mass noun. *AGI is.* Do you feel it now, Ilya?

I can see you tripping over each other to object. Are you trolling? I am not. Much of science has progressed on the backs of ideas that other people do not like. Let me know if you find something wrong on the merits.

Okay, I'm not trolling (I say), but isn't the argument self-defeating? Doesn't running the argument presuppose relations we can't have? Let's have Gemini back to take this question:

> Wittgenstein's Ladder refers to a concept from Ludwig Wittgenstein's "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus." It metaphorically suggests that his philosophical propositions are like a ladder to be climbed for understanding. However, once you reach that understanding, you realize that the propositions served as tools, not as realities in themselves. Just like a ladder is discarded once you reach the desired platform, the philosophical propositions are no longer needed. The metaphor highlights the limitations of language in capturing certain aspects of reality, and encourages us to move beyond philosophical propositions and seek a direct, unmediated understanding of the world.

I know Della Rocca won't mind that I took his replies to objections, too. How can he, when the distinction between him and I is nonsensical, anyway? Now that I've solved AGI, I'm going to retire. In this essay I---

---am being facetious again. But there are practical conclusions to the Parmenidean Ascent.

We live in a world of distinctions we can't get away from. And to be fair, distinctions are often useful, such as the one between train and test. One need not convert to radical monism to be an effective research engineer. But language is about shared understanding, and I want to raise AGI as a region of below average clarity, one which great effort to clarify hasn't entirely succeeded. Many people believe AGI should be set apart from other great inventions in history. Maybe that's a result of the lack of clarity of what AGI is. Or the lack of clarity of what AGI is causes people to believe that AGI should be set apart.

To be clear, I'm not saying that building something most people would call an AGI is impossible. Instead, I more and more see the world where we build a machine that people agree is AGI before we write some words that people agree defines AGI. So I'll take less interest in drawing the distinction a priori. There are already hard distinctions to make in distributed systems, codebase design, and hypothesis testing. There's not much bandwidth left to stake claims in philosophical realms fraught with people's enduring assumptions.

But we can be more creative in the distinctions we commit ourselves to. We can be more sympathetic to the view that [AGI is already here](https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/). And we can challenge long-held distinctions closer to implementation. The one between agent and environment is one, picking up the project that Martin Heidegger, via Hubert Dreyfus, [left us long ago](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370207001452).

To gauge how ambitious a goal is, we can look to its concreteness instead of its scope creep. It's no accident that Demis Hassabis cites a [clear objective function](https://youtu.be/XtJVLOe4cfs?feature=shared&t=1661) as indispensable in problems suitable for AI. It's why everything I write gestures loudly towards David Deutsch [correctly predicting our chatbot status quo](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/03/philosophy-artificial-intelligence) now almost twelve years ago. [We still don't understand the brain.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02120-8) To convert a skeptic, build their world, don't redefine it.

To this end, let me be concrete in how the Parmenidean Ascent changed my research engineering.

The code you write, the interfaces you define: they are all ladders, in the Wittgensteinian sense. Settle for some abstractions, but pledge yourself loosely. You will want different ones, and you should rewrite everything often. Conventionally, an interface defines what the user is allowed to do. This contract can get in your head; you can think they are untouchable. But good research is always at an edge case. And underneath every interface is actually just code you can change. I remember shoehorning my special case into a long-standing library. A colleague: "There must be some interface you can implement!" There was, but not one better than rewriting just the functionality we needed. These ladders are meant to be drafted, climbed, and then discarded.

My other suggestion is to literally kill distinctions. More projects die, swamped by complexity, than from not being clever enough. The best bug I found this year was a global JAX optimization slapped on our codebase without regard for another routine. Deep in the source, we found one line documenting why the routine ran thread-local in special cases. Another colleague exclaimed, "This bug is an interaction between this code, which is horrible, and that code, which isn't tested!" His exclamation wasn't even about this bug---it came after a whole different day of shape error debugging. I'm radicalized against "features." A "feature" often disguises an ill-conceived distinction.

I keep thinking about a comment from David Ha: [AI is the branch of study called applied philosophy.](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1493026762514890752) We can live as an amateur applied philosopher designing everything from a research plan to a python protocol. We should in all aspects; all aspects are the same. I will emphasize my point in [a final shameless adaptation](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html):

> The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage ~~computation~~ [monism] are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. The ultimate reason for this is ~~Moore's law~~ [the Parmenidean Ascent], or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling ~~cost per unit of computation~~ [into regress, circles, or dogmatism]. Most AI research has been conducted as if the ~~computation available~~ [problems remaining] to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more ~~computation~~ [explanatory demand] inevitably ~~becomes available~~ [must be met]. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the ~~leveraging of computation~~ [elimination of distinctions]. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging ~~computation~~ [monism]. There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent...

Let us return to the world where we tolerate counting. And to the main path we have neglected, to see what other ladders we can find.

The second sense research engineers have is hearing. Sound is the preferred medium through which humans transfer myth.

In September Benjamín Labatut published [*The MANIAC*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/75665931). It's about Paul Ehrenfest, John von Neumann, the artificial life they dreamed, and ends with AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol. It follows Labatut's earlier opus, [*When We Cease to Understand the World*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62069739-when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world), which is spiritually similar to Alan Lightman's [*Einstein's Dreams*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/14376). It also inspired the recent [*Ubi Sunt*](https://www.ubisunt.net/) by Blaise Agüera y Arca. All these fictions are loosely based on real people and events, and make the scientists, their obsessions, and their dilemmas real to the reader.

But more than just historical fiction, these works capture a zeitgeist. They describe fictional memories and scientific concepts to the fidelity of non-fiction. And they project the meaning of their present on the future. *Ubi Sunt*, for example, ponders LLM-catalyzed information overload, hallucinations, and human-computer empathy---published before the current wave of LLMs.

In the spirit of the same age, I'll call this genre, "humans hallucinating in a productive way before computers did it." And let me make another leap. This productive human hallucination is the modern instantiation of scientists engaging in mythmaking, in the historiographical sense. As [Paul Cohen tells it](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/196727):

> [The] past treated as myth is fundamentally different from the past treated as history. When good historians write history, their primary objective is to construct, on the basis of the evidence available, as accurate and truthful an understanding of the past as possible. Mythologizers, in a sense, do the reverse... to draw on it to serve the political, ideological, rhetorical, and/or emotional needs of the present.

Cohen contrasts history as myth (how we interpret and remember what happened) with history as event (the facts) and history as experience (the subjective). For example, in the winter of 1899 a group rebelled against the Qing dynasty in a conflict that killed 100,000 people (event). That number is just a statistic to those who weren't there---but one's own starvation, pursuit, and torture is quite individual (experience). And there's a reason why the Boxer Rebellion, with its Chinese martial arts stereotypes, is far better known than even the [second bloodiest war in human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion) (myth). There are many debates about what history is. I won't go into them, because focusing on this (dare I say it) distinction is helpful.

Times change, politics change, myths change. So much the more in one of the fastest moving and most globally connected scientific fields in history.

For one, how should we think about LLMs? This year was a reaction against the sparks-floaters and the consciousness-curious. After the spring of GPT, a summer of guarded judgments. In May, [Yiu, Kosoy, and Gopnik](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07666) argued that models are not intelligent agents, but "efficient imitation engines" that "enhance cultural transmission." Later that month, [Matt Botvinick described](https://medium.com/@matthew.botvinick/have-we-lost-our-minds-86d9125bd803) his unease at how others described progress: "Consciousness is a thing that makes other things matter." And while we cannot ignore that LLMs show a language ungrounded in an experiencing subject, [Ted Underwood in June](https://critinq.wordpress.com/2023/06/29/the-empirical-triumph-of-theory/) hesitated to "give twentieth-century theorists the victory lap they deserve." And just in time to ring in the new year, we rehabilitated hallucinations from a bug to an [LLM's greatest feature](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1733299213503787018).

And how should we act in response? Certain labels encapsulate history as myth---doomers, altruists, accelerationists. These and other conceptions of AI are not all insular. After one [failed petition](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) in March, another [amassed broad support](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) in May. An executive order and summits followed. In a memer coup, varying qualities of shoggoth cartoon appeared in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2) in April (its app's [most shared](https://www.ft.com/content/3c28ed96-21b8-45a4-867b-3e8cdf72ba4e) story) and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/shoggoth-meme-ai.html) in May. And taking over a [panoramic streetfront across the Warriors stadium](https://misalignmentmuseum.com/) in September is no evidence of insularity, either.

Technical research isn't exempt. [Schick et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) in February and [Park et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) in April each captured and advanced their nascent paradigm at the right time, for self-supervised tool use and language models embedded in agents, respectively. A third paper, [Schaeffer et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15004)  in April, took aim at a ubiquitous story: that of emergent properties from scaling. For its efforts in counter-mythmaking, the field recognized this work with one of its most prestigious annual awards: outstanding paper at NeurIPS.

Then there is the history as myth of how we got here. In [one telling](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/why_brain/) from March, TensorFlow, the Transformer, JAX, and a very long list besides are to the credit of a bottom-up research culture. Per [another telling](https://www.fromthenew.world/p/diminishing-returns-in-machine-learning) from May, we should understand progress in machine learning as hardware-driven. In a third, it's its people that a research lab is nothing without.

People use history as myth to push for places to go. There is the mythos of open-source, for one. The bomb and the hard silicon of the valley are also exemplars. The physicists and semiconductor magnates all knew each other; whether we cast immigrants as scientists or spies [carries very real consequences](https://tianyu.co/p/oppenheimer-and-after) for their visas as well as all innovation. Nolan's *Oppenheimer*, then, either tells us that [big government science just ain't what it used to be](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1682809958734131200), or is a [warning against yielding to its allure](https://michaelnotebook.com/oppenheimer/index.html) without considering its ethics. As a prognosticator, history as myth is so fickle that an aging corporation (a "gatekeeper," according to one new regulation) is either recently unfashionable but just begun its third life, or has recently developed a reputation of not shipping and so is on its way to the grave. How myths change to reflect the time.

So what does this mean for us aspiring, amateur applied historians?

Make history as myth. To be clear: history as myth is not bad, or even wrong. Quite the contrary. It's an essential counterpart to event and experience. And it's a practice that research engineers neglect. Remember, it's productive hallucination. In the same way that even (especially) Herodotus and Sima Qian hallucinated productively. In every new present, history as myth must adapt to new events, ideologies, and emotions.

For Cohenian history, as event, experience, and myth does happen. Clearly history as event happens: [Tyler Cowen charges us](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/existential-risk-and-the-turn-in-human-history.html) in March for living in a "bubble outside of history... indeed most of us are psychologically unable to truly imagine living in moving history." Truly so many events happened this year. For a full inventory refer to [Nathan Benaich's report](https://www.stateof.ai/) and [Gavin Leech's reading list](https://twitter.com/g_leech_/status/1740027508727464312). But history as event is less in our control than we think. I agree with [John Vernon's conclusion](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/12/books/exhuming-a-dirty-joke.html): "history's ultimate unknowability" mocks those with a passionate interest in it.

Clearly history as experience happens: "[To all of you, our team:](https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board) I am sure books are going to be written about this time period, and I hope the first thing they say is how amazing the entire team has been." We may not see the primary sources of history of experience for a long time, if ever.

To whom remains history as myth? In the previous examples, all its practitioners. Contrary to common perception, it doesn't trade off with actual fact. In the words of one of our greatest mythmakers, [the inimitable Tolkien](https://coolcalvary.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/on-fairy-stories1.pdf):

> Fantasy is a natural human activity. It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason; and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity. On the contrary. The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make.

Embrace history as myth; get better at it. Through it one can generate the motivation, collaborations, and policy wished for. Moreover, one can create better stories than what is out there. Jessica Dai [advocated for as much in alignment](https://joinreboot.org/p/alignment) in August. Some people are quick to disavow themselves from doomers or accelerationists. But what else is on offer? Not much, if research engineers continue to see mythmaking as a chore, second-class, a lesser use of their time to "real" technical work. They will keep working in a world under a myth they keep complaining is inferior.

They especially take our blistering, hyperconnected field for granted. Here, builders really do have the most credibility to make history as myth. Any student, with a nice paper and a timely thread on née Twitter, can nudge the course of trillion-dollar market caps. A far cry from the past. A hundred years ago in the Chinese Republic, only established luminaries like Hu Shi and Cai Yuanpei could concern themselves with mythologizing the Boxers. By the Cultural Revolution, doing so fell solely to Party propagandists. We do science in a pluralist nursery of mythmaking. Better ones generally win with persuasion from reason---if they exist in the first place.

The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage history as myth are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.

<p align='center'>&#8258;</p>

The third sense is smell.

The microhistorian Carlo Ginzburg [took on our (possibly doomed) project](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4288283) to find the "borderline... between science and everything else---social sciences, arts humanities... [to] go beyond the sterile contrasting of the ‘rational' and ‘irrational'."

His esoterica is a joy to peruse. He unifies Giovanni Morelli's method to attribute art, Sherlock Holmes' to uncover clues, and Freud's to conduct psychoanalysis. He claims common ground between these and the rise of disciplines in history:

> For thousands of years mankind lived by hunting. In the course of endless pursuits hunters learned to construct the appearance and movements of an unseen quarry through its tracks---prints in soft ground, snapped twigs, droppings, snagged hairs or feathers, smells, puddles, threads of saliva. They learnt to sniff, to observe, to give meaning and context to the slightest trace.

We usually see the sciences as taking a nomothetic approach. Mythmaking, too, directs us to imagine a narrative and unite around it. But it doesn't completely describe the day-to-day of modern AI research. Our complex and indeterminate systems encourages rich, contextual, individual focus. In fact, there is another field that this characterizes well. Chris Olah (a great research engineer) [points this out](http://colah.github.io/notes/bio-analogies/):

> This essay is about a different set of analogies which I think are underrated: analogies to biology. Where physics analogies often encourage us to zoom out and focus on the big picture, analogies to biology often suggest looking more closely at the details and internal structure of neural networks.

Olah mainly discusses technical analogies; he indicated [another connection](https://twitter.com/ch402/status/1659284365380313088) in May. It's not uncommon for AI research to reference life science frameworks. In July [McGrath et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15771) suggested motivating interpretability research with Tinbergen's four questions.

Here, I'll focus more on what Olah calls "[the aesthetic to bring](https://twitter.com/ch402/status/1533164918886703104)." I put to you that the aesthetic to bring is the same one that unifies Morelli, Holmes, Freud, and hunter-gatherers millennia ago---following their nose, giving meaning and context to the slightest trace. Call it "researchers overfitting" to the details. As in the life sciences, we have a wealth of methods and attitudes in common.

Ablations are an obvious example. A biologist friend was tickled to see the [ablations diagram in the AlphaStar paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.pdf#page=4), not knowing ablations as a common experiment to report in AI. It was a fun fact for me to learn that its use in a biological context, the surgical removal of a body part, was [first attested in the 14th century](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ablation).

If you think about it, ablations really don't explain very much. Ablating a component results in changes, but the experimenter is hard pressed to isolate the causes of data, model, and evaluation. As a field we accept ablations, though---it's part of the aesthetic to accept such a tradeoff. Saffron Huang (another great research engineer) drew an apt comparison to traditional Chinese medicine in May:

> There's little evidence so far for the theory underpinning acupuncture, but there is decent empirical evidence for acupuncture itself. This is surprisingly similar to AI. We don't really understand it, the theory is slim and unsatisfying, but it indisputably "works" in many ways...

> The most accurate explanatory model of a phenomenon is not always the best predictive model. Machine learning is an approach that accepts the predictive power of the Faustian bargain, trading away explainability.

The visualization premium is another shared attitude. Tools of visualization drive science: the telescope, the microscope, and unexpectedly, the GPU. Everybody knows that everybody should visualize their data and evaluations. Plot distributions, talk to your chatbot, watch videos of your agent. Look at [gradient noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06162). This year I labeled some data, and it viscerally hurt to label examples wrong. Who among us, if we measured how much time we spent doing these things, would feel that the time spent was enough? Asking for a friend.

James Somers (you're not gonna believe it, another great research engineer) describes biology from a computer scientist's perspective:

> A day of programming might involve constructing an elaborate regular expression, investigating a file descriptor leak, debugging a race condition in the application you just wrote, and thinking through the interface of a module. Everywhere you look---the compiler, the shell, the CPU, the DOM---is an abstraction hiding lifetimes of work. Biology is like this, just much, much worse, because living systems aren't intentionally designed. It's all a big slop of global mutable state...

> [In] in trying to acquire a reading knowledge of biology it's almost more useful to study the methods than any individual facts. That's because the methods are highly conserved across studies. Everybody does Western blots. Everybody does flow cytometry and RNA-seq.

Somers advocates for better visualization tools to understand complex biological systems. His argument applies just as well to AI systems. We can mimic his aesthetic; he should have all loved biology, he says, because someone should have shaken him by the shoulders and instilled the astonishment of how from a single cell, dividing over and over, emerges a human brain. "People ought to be walking around all day, all through their waking hours calling to each other in endless wonderment, talking of nothing except that cell." We should be doing that about our thinking sand.

Then there is thinking at different scales. This paragraph opens the [Cell Press primer for scaling](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(08)01411-5):

> Ernest Rutherford is credited with the provocative assertion that all attempts to expand human knowledge are either physics or stamp collecting. Whatever your opinion of this statement, the two modes are not mutually exclusive, and some of the most interesting efforts to marry the two endeavours have looked at questions of scale in biology. Evolution may drive species to different sizes, shapes, energetic lifestyles and behaviours, but the laws of physics govern both the internal workings of life and its interaction with the external environment. For example, imagine taking a five centimetre tall shrew and multiplying each of its length dimensions by a factor of sixty to produce an elephant-sized shrew. What would happen? The weight that an animal's limbs must support scales with its volume, yet the forces that its bones can withstand or its muscles can produce scale with area. And so this animal would be in serious trouble, to say the least.

It hits familiar notes. Interpret scaling relationships with caution, because species may not represent an independent sample of how features scale. Scaling relationships may oversimplify underlying mechanisms; they are not strict laws. What if we couldn't even [see humans emerge](https://twitter.com/jachiam0/status/1641895688941477888) with scale? And Ernest Rutherford is an all-time great research engineer.

To think at different scales, turn the crank of a metaphorical renormalization group, generalized over one's own research. Underneath every abstraction is another world to understand. At large scales, [cosmic-ray-induced neutrinos](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6193419) can cause silent data corruption.  At small scales, we saw [the most dramatic optimization to nanoGPT](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1621578354024677377) so far.

Revisiting ablations while thinking at different scales, biologists ablate at the level of [gene expression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25517468/) in gene therapy, [cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31359086/), and entire organs. Revisiting visualization while thinking at different scales, biologists visualize at the level of [gene expression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888751/figure/DEV196600F3/), [proteins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20664080/), [cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923835/figure/F3/), and [cellular networks](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00897/full). AI research this year saw the growth of tools at scales from [intermediate function values](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/oryx/notebooks/a_tour_of_oryx) to [families of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373). We could taxonomize our scales even further. Thinking at different scales doesn't just mean changing the parameter count.

To leverage scale, leverage the natural. Viruses are good candidates to deploy gene editing because of their naturally evolved mechanisms. Natural inspiration has a long track record of success in AI research, too. I thank Andrej Karpathy (say it with me) for retrieving from Dzmitry Bahdanau and [presenting at ICVSS this example](https://twitter.com/prafull7/status/1678344322729558021) in July:

> So I tried instead something simpler---two cursors moving at the same time synchronously (effectively hard-coded diagonal attention). That sort of worked, but the approach lacked elegance.

> So one day I had this thought that it would be nice to enable the decoder RNN to learn to search where to put the cursor in the source sequence. This was sort of inspired by translation exercises that learning English in my middle school involved. Your gaze shifts back and forth between source and target sequence as you translate. I expressed the soft search as softmax and then weighted averaging of BiRNN states. It worked great from the very first try to my great excitement. I called the architecture RNNSearch. and we rushed to publish an ArXiV paper as we knew that llya and co at Google are somewhat ahead of us with their giant 8 GPU LSTM model (RNN Search still ran on 1 GPU).

> As it later turned out, the name was not great. The better name (attention) was only added by Yoshua to the conclusion in one of the final passes.

There's something deeper behind these methodological similarities that keep cropping up. It's understudied, and best left to a better biologist than I. I leave these sketches in the spirit of giving meaning and context to the slightest trace.

The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage the researcher overfitting to certain details are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.

<p align='center'>&#8258;</p>

The fourth sense is sight.

Following our nose prompts us to observe, visualize, and let loose our curiosity. But it has traps. Minutiae misses the forest for the trees, invites over-interpretation, and is indifferent to reproducibility. Seeing the distance ahead avoids these traps. If myth is the grand theory, and overfitting to traces is unconstrained optimization, sight is the architectural prior. It is prudent to not fight the constraints of nature. As my friend admonished me as we descended Ben Nevis at twilight, without flashlights: "Worrying won't make the sun go down any slower."

The bottleneck to space travel will be biology, not engineering. I heard this argument in August, and it's underrated in tech circles. Anthony Wang noted that [half the crew of Apollo missions suffered from infections](https://espresso.economist.com/45204519c15e0b1ce35f9d4b63749226) upon landing on Earth.  [Gene expression changes in just a few orbits.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0499_359)  Though [the Twins Study results](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau8650) seem overall promising for long-term human spaceflight, some puzzles remain. And [even](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-023-00273-4) [more](https://academic.oup.com/ced/article-abstract/48/10/1128/7160873) [studies](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg1610) that probe these questions were published this year. Unsurprisingly, that intelligent agent trained on Earth is not so robust to out of distribution evaluations in space.

The theme is thinking that engineering genius applied to the surviving artifact (spaceships for humans; fine-tuning; scaling up, if you like) can overcome an initial direction off the mark (terrestriality; bad data; a partial paradigm). It's far easier (and harder) to get the initial direction right.

It reminds me of [Maciej Cegłowski's essay](https://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm) on the story of scurvy. The Royal Navy had citrus juice. Then through some confounders they lost the knowledge. After decades of sailors getting scurvy, two doctors found Vitamin C again with a healthy dose of sheer luck. It won't be a great mystery why I'm quoting it:

> There are several aspects of this 'second coming' of scurvy in the late 19th century that I find particularly striking:

> First, the fact that from the fifteenth century on, it was the rare doctor who acknowledged ignorance about the cause and treatment of the disease. The sickness could be fitted to so many theories of disease---imbalance in vital humors, bad air, acidification of the blood, bacterial infection---that despite the existence of an unambiguous cure, there was always a raft of alternative, ineffective treatments. At no point did physicians express doubt about their theories, however ineffective.

> Second, how difficult it was to correctly interpret the evidence without the concept of 'vitamin'... It was not clear which results were the anomalous ones that needed explaining away. The ptomaine theory made correct predictions (fresh meat will prevent scurvy) even though it was completely wrong.

> Third, how technological progress in one area can lead to surprising regressions... An even starker example was the rash of cases of infantile scurvy that afflicted upper class families in the late 19th century. This outbreak was the direct result of another technological development, the pasteurization of cow's milk. The procedure made milk vastly safer for infants to drink, but also destroyed vitamin C...

> Fourth, how small a foundation of evidence was necessary to build a soaring edifice of theory. Lind's famous experiment, for example, had two sailors eating oranges for six days. Lind went on to propound a completely ineffective method of preserving lemon juice (by boiling it down), which he never thought to test.

It sounds like I'm accusing AI researchers of gross negligence. But actually, like in the story of scurvy, it's more complicated than simple villainy. Like our counterparts from this archetypal tale in the Age of Sail, AI researchers face many pressures. Real resource constraints, career stress, and having too many confounders all sound right. Yes it's true, launching an experiment is faster than launching a polar expedition. But hyperparameter sweeps still combinatorially explode, so it's easy to lose sight.

In data and evaluations, we have obvious indicators of huge returns to foresight. [OpenFold analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.20.517210v2.full) showed that training on just 7.6 percent of the full training set reached comparable performance to the model trained on the full set. These are tiny datasets, mind---10,000 examples. In JAIR this May, [Gehrmann et al.](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/13715/26927) surveyed the growing challenges in evaluating language generation. Unconstrained optimization would scale up human evaluation despite its cost, time, computation, subjectivity, and the degrading nature of the labor. Again, one can think of that as the easier, and harder, path.

A dumb example from my dallying this year. We wrote a function to name some outputs in our codebase. Our overkill solution was to append the first ten 4-bit hexadecimal characters of a SHA-256 hash to a user-defined name. So for our humble codebase that produced a couple file outputs a day, we were happy to accept something like `sqrt(2 * 2^(10 * 4) * 0.5)` ~ one million files named before a fifty-fifty chance of a collision. It's not supposed to happen. No AI here. Now, this codebase trained models with many, many weights. Deary me, one in a million---I wonder what the hit rate of good weights to bad weights is?

In looking out at the guiding north star, I very much enjoyed this [survey of perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09323) a few weeks ago. Andrew Gordon Wilson would reframe how we motivate AI for science:

> Consider general relativity (GR) as a running example. GR is primarily exciting not because it enables GPS, which is an impactful application, but because it tells us how gravity, time, and space interact, towards a multitude of different applications. GPS wasn't even envisaged when GR was proposed. While we probably could hack a neural network together to correct for gravitational time dilation to make GPS possible, we would lack an underlying understanding that enables many other applications, including applications we don't currently foresee. Similarly, special relativity is in some sense "merely" an interpretation of the Lorentz transformations (which were experimental correction factors), but is viewed as a much more significant contribution than the equations, due to the fundamental understanding it provides.

Physics has some of the hardest constraints of nature. Imposing one's own myth (in theory of reality) or overfitting to chosen rather than discovered details (make GPS work) falls short. Here are more parallels---not just with historical cases of fumbling discovery as with scurvy, but with fields experiencing their own replication crises. The increasing drumbeat for demo and spectacle. The race to replicate a "low-key research preview" rather than to render a breakthrough that justifies one. Researchers have much to improve in their data and evaluations, sure. But there's more gain in setting up how we feed and evaluate AI research itself.

C. Thi Nguyen, a philosopher of games among other topics, in December [formalized this general problem](https://philpapers.org/go.pl?aid=NGUVCH) in life:

> Value capture happens when:

> 1. An agent has values which are rich, subtle, or inchoate (or they are in the process of developing such values).
> 2. That agent is immersed in some larger context (often an institutional context) that presents an explicit expression of some value (which is typically simplified, standardized, and/or quantified).
> 3. This explicit expression of value, in unmodified form, comes to dominate the entity's practical reasoning and deliberative process in the relevant domain.

> If you'd like a portable version, try this: value capture happens when a person or group adopts an externally-sourced value as their own, without adapting it to their particular context.

Dileep Rao, independently around the same time, called it [running RL on academia](https://deliprao.substack.com/p/the-great-ai-weirding). GitHub commits, and Kaggle rankings, and the h-index capture individual researchers. But also, entire research groups themselves may have their values captured by pleasing users and their mutual mimetic desires.

Values, desired or adopted, like a researcher's demands, like our senses, and unlike a single reward signal, can contradict. Yet we have to hold many in mind at the same time. [Nguyen again](https://academic.oup.com/book/32137):

> A yoga teacher once told me that we all needed to develop a pair of opposing capacities. We need to be flexible, but we also need to be strong, to control that flexibility. More flexibility, by itself, would just make it easier the world to push us around and hurt us. This, she said, is why we need to have a yoga practice that builds strength and power, along with flexibility. Freedom comes from a balance of flexibility and control.

The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage thinking about direction, unperturbed by premature optimization, are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.

<p align='center'>&#8258;</p>

The fifth and final sense is taste.

C. Thi Nguyen again, via Johan Huizinga:

> Play, not rationality, is the characteristic activity of humans.

Michael Della Rocca again:

> "OK, here it comes," I say to the reader as I see that... a limit to their patience has been reached.

> And the reader---perhaps you---says, "You bet, it's coming. How can we take your view seriously? The abandonment of relational metaphysics, the abandonment of all distinctions, the embrace of self-undermining? You have to be joking."

> And I say: "Yes, indeed, I do have to be joking, for, as I argued... engaging in joking and, more generally, play is (happily) all we can do once we abandon the incoherent aims a certain kind of pervasive attempt at metaphysical thinking."

In my time as a research engineer so far, I have enjoyed many, too many to count, meditations on research taste. My only contribution to the literature is this:

Are you having fun?

The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research...

Eugène Delacroix, August 27, 1854:

> They are going to launch a large vessel called a clipper at noon today. Another of these American inventions to make people go faster and faster. When they have managed to get travellers comfortably seated inside a cannon so that they can be shot off like bullets in any given direction civilisation will doubtless have taken a great step forward. We are making rapid strides towards that happy time when space will have been abolished; but they will never abolish boredom, especially when you consider the ever increasing need for some occupation to fill in our time, part of which, at least, used to be spent in travelling.

I'm upholding my promise to limit annoying references to my foreign travels. So here's the section you can opt out of. This June Agnes Callard published her infamous [case against travel](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/the-case-against-travel). As much as I like some of her other opinions, she is wrong. I think that suffices as a rebuttal. However, next year I resolve not to get on a plane over the summer. The summer is hot, expensive, draws too many people, and I miss out on the longest days in London.

This year I spent time in these places for the first time: Arosa, Châtel, Muscat, Kigali, Dalaman, Kayseri, Istanbul, Rome, Tokyo, Kyoto, Seoul, Honolulu, Pittsburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne, Annapolis, and the Scottish Highlands (Inverness, Drumnadrochit, and Fort William). Other than south England and Arizona, I went back to New York, Beijing, and the Bay Area.

The first thing I want to talk about is paper, at airports. So much of the logistical miracle of airports still depends on the successful use of paper. Japan exceeded my expectations, even when accounting for the fact that Japan would exceed my expectations. In such a smoothly-running country, I can only nitpick Narita International Airport for being kind of janky. It depends on the airline, but my experience was this: get in one line for your bag drop. You get a paper ticket. You take it to a different line to pay for your bag. I tried to use an Apple Card, edge case, big mistake. (No card number printed on the card.) (I also hope the end of the Apple / GS partnership doesn't result future foreign transaction fees.) So I gave the attendant my phone with the card number on it. They copied onto a piece of paper. Then they copied it off that piece of paper into the computer right next to it, a one foot travel in all.

Another time I had a 50 minute connection. As I rushed through the closing gate, I saw the gate attendant cross my name off a long list of handwritten names. I assume if someone forgot to copy my name down they would've left without me. A third time I got to the airport at the original time for a delayed flight. I could go through security early though, because a piece of paper stuck to a desk (in reach of anybody) had my flight number on it, again handwritten. These all happened at nice airports. There's a deep lesson somewhere there about automation, and about hand-copying lists.

I visited many castles this year. I'll compare ones in Rome, New Rome, and beyond the reach of Rome (Anglican Protestantism). Topkapi Palace made the appeal of real estate make sense to me. There's a pavilion on the edge of the third courtyard overlooking the Bosphorus. [Towering columns over the best view of the whole city.](https://www.budgettraveltalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Topkapi-Palace-Views-in-Istanbul.jpg) The palace has [many such views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bosphorus_view_Topkapi_Istanbul_2007.jpg). I always knew about the architectural extravagances of autocrats (like Mussolini's demolition for the Via dei Fori Imperiali). Experiencing a shadow of what a sultan had, in the sun and the breeze, trying to ignore nearby tourists, was something else. Topkapi totally justified its park map, like a botanical garden or some kind of Disneyland.

East of the sleepy village of Drumnadrochit, Urquhart Castle sits on the bank of Loch Ness. For over two hundred years, it and Topkapi Palace were in use at the same time. Each was the top tier, if not the best, royal residence in their respective time and civilization. In luxury, Urquhart Castle is much worse. Topkapi housed up to 4,000 inhabitants; in the "Great Raid of 1545" at Urquhart Castle, the MacDonalds made off with less than half as many goats. [In views, though, Urquhart Castle holds its own.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urquhart_Castle#/media/File:Urquhart_Castle_Panorama.jpg) Nobody needs that much space; you just need a loyal gatekeeper and a nice boat. You can even see the Loch Ness monster. The Highlands are a different world depending on time of day---fog cloaking the rolling hills and ancient glens in the morning, colorful autumn leaves basking in afternoon golden rays, and torrential downpour on unlit cobblestones at night, the perfect backdrop to a murder mystery.

Newcastle's eponymous castle (The Castle, Newcastle, or Newcastle Castle) had some interesting placards. One medieval breastplate had a conspicuous dent on its right. Apparently smiths would shoot their own work before selling it---the "bullet proof." The mason who designed Newcastle Castle (his name was Maurice) earned a shilling a day. The entire castle cost King Henry II about 1,100 pounds. Some quick math means that, Maurice, had he been born with his skills, working every day, saving every penny, would still have to work 60 years to afford the castle he built. Senior staff research engineers, eat your heart out.

I seem to average about one Hadrian landmark a year. Hadrian's Wall two years ago, the Arch of Hadrian (Jerash, not Athens) last year, and the Castel Sant'Angelo this June. The Castel Sant'Angelo is an extremely well-designed museum experience. You first descend into Hadrian's mausoleum, before ascending around the rotunda through time. Exhibits on the middle levels show how the structure changed from tomb to castle to prison. It's got frescoes, cannons, miniatures, and more. You shouldn't go just for the rooftop restaurant, but I should mentioned that its alcoves look right across the Tiber to St. Peter's Basilica. [This painting is accurate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Sant%27Angelo#/media/File:Rome,_a_view_of_the_river_Tiber_looking_south_with_the_Castel_Sant'Angelo_and_Saint_Peter's_Basilica_beyond_by_Rudolf_Wiegmann_1834.jpg)

The last castle of note was actually moored right in front of Topkapi Palace. Every time I crossed Galata Bridge I wondered what that large boat was parked between Europe and Asia. It turns out it's Türkiye's first aircraft carrier, the [Anadolu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCG_Anadolu), commissioned a month before I visited. I guess its placement was no coincidence. The week I was there was the week between the election and its runoff. It's trite to say that Istanbul hosts many different lives. But in addition to the fishermen, street food vendors, ferry, cruise ship, the dome of a mosque, the dome of a church, and the cat that everyone expects, now you can *also* get an aircraft carrier in the same camera frame.

Having surveyed castles with respect to Rome, now we'll move on to trains with respect to capitals. Namely, the Northern Capital, the Eastern Capital, and just literally, the [Capital City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Seoul). I like how each Seoul subway line has its own little jingle. Subway stations also have full-length mirrors, and tell you where the best secondary schools are. Unfortunately, Korea's fastest bullet trains only run once every two hours from Seoul. So with my just-in-time-compiled travel style, they were all sold out by the time I wanted to book one. So I'm unable to compare them for you. But that's endogenous.

The Tokaido Shinkansen, on the other hand, runs every twelve minutes. I only have two notes. First, it's cool that the [seats can rotate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ArK5grG7ZY) so that you're always facing the direction of travel. But as a result, all the windows are a little too far back for optimal leaning and staring. I suppose consistency is better than what airlines do, where you either get two windows or the structural post and no view at all. Second, the food cart is cash only. It reflects the wider tyranny of cash, especially coins, in Japan. Sometimes you win coin Tetris when buying a subway ticket, and that almost makes up for it. (Due to a chip shortage, no new PASMO cards.) All considered though, Haneda to central Tokyo costs 30 minutes and three dollars, so Japan easily wins my combined train award.

In China, I tried both Hexie and Fuxing. Did you know that they name Hexie (harmony) series trains (older, based on foreign technology) for Hu Jintao's policy (和谐社会; harmonious society), while they named Fuxing (rejuvenation) series trains (newer, all Chinese technology) for Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream (中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦; the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation)? This fun fact is not on Wikipedia. (And does no new paramount leaders mean no new trains?)

They are good trains. Hexie is anachronistic. It's going faster than the Eurostar, yet the television is communal, square aspect ratio, and pixelated. On Fuxing you get branded slippers in business class. They also have, can you believe it, an American-sized toilet in the on-train bathroom. There's a cap to how luxurious trains can be, though. Fuxing is not that much smoother than the Shinkansen. It doesn't live up to its can-balance-a-dime-on-its-edge fame. People complain about Amtrak, saying that only the Northeast corridor is profitable. Well, according someone I talked to, actually China only has one profitable line too---Beijing to Shanghai. Infrastructure in and around Beijing advances one Olympic Games at a time.

I hadn't been back to China for six years before October. A lot else has changed. 

Even within the fourth ring road (where my grandparents live), Beijing feels more suburban. The streets are cleaner. There used to be a pile where the whole block threw away their trash. (A deep memory is holding my nose every time I walked by it.) It's now an Amazon locker (Chinese version of) and a row of bins you can open with an overhead pulley system. There's no more street vendors (the government shut them down long before the pandemic). You can still see the pandemic in some places. Everyone in the services industry still wears a mask. But I got less shrink-wrapped dishware at restaurants (a proof of cleanliness). My grandparents installed a bidet.

Most taxi cabs are now electric. Incredibly, they're still 2.3 yuan per kilometer, a price that hasn't gone up since 2013. And now they have seatbelts (instead of hiding them under a nice seat cover). Two Didi drivers even reminded me to put it on. I don't see any three-wheeled rickshaws taxi alternatives anymore. There also used to be graveyards of city bikes spilling into the street. Now they're lined up neatly by color. Each bus still has two employees---the driver and a second guy sitting at a tiny desk with the passengers, selling paper tickets. But the new buses don't have paper tickets anymore, so neither do they have the tiny ticket desk. So now the second guy just stands around, basically paid to ride the bus, occasionally telling people to move along inside. Though one time a little kid threw up on the bus, giving him something to do. Automation is hard part two.

I crashed two weddings happening in adjacent ballrooms at a restaurant. (The restaurant was hosting three or four concurrent weddings.) Earlier I saw a life-sized poster of a couple getting married that day. I joked to my cousin, nice of them to make a poster so you don't forget who's getting married. "Oh no," she said. "It's so you don't end up at the wrong wedding."

Weddings are chaotic and efficient. As one bride was waiting to enter a ballroom, the train of her dress blocked the flow of traffic in the entire hallway. Pretty soon there was a crowd of people on either side waiting to cross. Do you want to guess the song that played when she walked in, down a red carpet to meet her groom? Christina Perri, A Thousand Years.

Paint The Town Red was already in top 50 most popular song charts on QQ. (When I was in Japan, Spotify Top 50 had a bunch of K-pop. When I was in Korea, Spotify Top 50 had a bunch of Taylor Swift. Why can't we just be happy with what we have?) But state media changed only a little. The news presenters were younger. They wore brighter colors. One of them even had highlights. They're very on top of their America coverage. Two weeks after the fact, they still had experts coming on to say that losing an F-35 is really bad, how embarrassing. They countered this somewhat by showing a very nice video of an F-35 vertically landing on a carrier, though. The day after Kevin McCarthy got fired, all my relatives knew that it was the first time that had ever happened in American history.

I wanted to watch some wuxia dramas. But flipping through the channels, Mao-era dramas outnumbered all other dramas five to one. Disappointing that that hadn't changed. The best thing I watched was the Hangzhou 2023 Asian Games. In addition to the usual suspects, they have chess, go, climbing, breakdancing, dragon boat racing, esports, and [Sepak takraw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTZquFDgZ0w), my favorite new discovery. More people should be talking about Sepak takraw.

Life with a mobile phone number and WeChat was so much more convenient than not having those things. I had to interact with two banks without, and it cost me hours of my life. You have to show up in person; you can't make an appointment. Reader, there was even a line, to use the elevator, to stand in another line, to talk about your own money. Another time I gave a barista cash, and she didn't have change. After asking her manager she gave me a cookie.

The infrastructure my uncle is proudest of is the post. He says it's the sign of a great nation that he can order something worth one yuan from Yunnan, and it's shipped for free to Beijing (1,300 miles away), with a free stick of incense worth another one yuan tacked on as if free shipping wasn't good enough. Plus, he added, FedEx (Chinese version of) needs drivers, which is great for youth unemployment.

As for me, the infrastructure I would emphasize is food. Here's an incomplete list of better foods: mushrooms, peanuts, peppers, tea, yogurt, all soups, some breads, tofu, grapes, egg yolk, grapefruit, pork, duck, eggplant. I actually went a whole week without eating a single grain of rice, probably my only week in last six years. In Japan, Korea, and China I could get a convenience store feast for less than five pounds. It puts triple that price point in many other places to shame. Night markets were also a big win for Hotelling.

In *Past Lives*, there's a part where Greta Lee's character describes seeing Teo Yoo's character, a childhood friend, again after over a decade. "He's so Korean... And he has all these really Korean views about everything. And I feel so not Korean when I'm with him. But also, in some way, more Korean? It's so weird. I mean, I have Korean friends, but he's not like Korean-American. He's Korean-Korean." Okay, I'm only a tiny bit Chinese-Chinese (all said I've lived in Beijing a couple years). But though I was only there a week, the nostalgia was overwhelming. These trips make me wonder what my life would have been like if I grew up in Beijing. I've resolved to return much more often. I left Beijing that day in early October those events of which, and since, are a harsh reminder that safety is precious and not guaranteed.

Back to lands where it's possible to get cold water. In China your only options are hot (see: scalding) or ambient (see: very hot but not yet boiling). Having lived outside America for two years, I will never take free ice water for granted again. At least you can get straight up lukewarm water in London.

Now I've seen some things that you can only see after living in London for two years. One time I was running alone in Kensington Gardens when it was raining. Not many other people went outside, and I had my own radius of no one in line of sight, across lots of grass. Rare, in central London. I went to PMQs, on a day where they actually had a debate about AI. I saw the [New Measurement Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Measurement_Train). And I've overheard all the [various codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Sands) that the tube stations use. If they didn't want to raise my suspicions about Inspector Sands, they wouldn't have prerecorded the message. Shrinkflation is everywhere but the Wimbledon strawberries and cream. For 13 years, they are still two pound fifty, still ten strawberries [hand-picked that morning](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/sports/tennis/wimbledon-strawberries-cream.html). After surveying truly very many, the best Indian restaurant in London: at the budget end, it's the Indian YMCA, a fifteen pound set buffet with actually yoghurty yogurt. At the high end, it's Trishna, where you should build a menu around the aloo tokri chaat, hariyali bream, lamb chop, and makai palak.

Another year of loyalty to Heathrow Airport. Now I know that Terminal 5 gate A10 is the worst gate (or the best; you get a long bus tour of Heathrow on the way to the plane). And the C gates are where the A380s park (it's a sign of a great airport to see how many of those you can line up). I go to Paddington for my commute, and one day, a [new artwork](https://gillieandmarc.art/blogs/news/a-marvellous-new-addition-to-paddington-the-wild-table-of-love) appeared. I actually like this one, unlike the man trapped inside the clock next to who tourists keep taking videos of. Some friend and I did an impromptu pastel de nata tasting competition on the table. I lost due to some unjust temperature shenanigans, even though one of the judges said he normalized for it.

[*Woolf Works*](https://waynemcgregor.com/productions/woolf-works) in March was my favorite performance of any kind. It might have been the shock of seeing professional ballet for the first time. I also already like Max Richter. Combined with the costumes, lights, and subject, nothing else can compete. It was just so much better than the disturbing time I had at the RA's Marina Abramović exhibit. Take [*Rhythm 10*](https://www.wikiart.org/en/marina-abramovic/rhythm-10), for example. I've given art after Turner the benefit of the doubt. I've said that if so many people get it, it must not be a scam. I'm ready to give up now---I've tried my best.

This year I watched more movies than TV (*Star Wars* reviews will have to wait another year). I liked both *The Boy and the Heron* and *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny*, above all for their scores that prominently feature strings. That just doesn't happen anymore. I'm boosted by my new dose of Miyazaki's magical realism (ah, the parakeets, of course). The Japanese title makes so much more sense. I spent way too long theorizing why the heron is a titular character. The Dial deservedly glorified its inventor Archimedes, the original research engineer.

Train chase scenes need to improve, across the industry. They seem to think that people only care about new ways to do the car chase. So they phone it in when it comes to train chase tropes. Some characters end up on the roof, and they have to do hand-to-hand combat, occasionally ducking for a tunnel. The bad guys blow up a bridge (or a nice viaduct), the good guys slam on the brakes, and the train hangs just so over the edge. At least *Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning* had cars fall one at a time, and featured a grand piano.

People made too big a deal about Ridley Scott's historical inaccuracy. One should read a book for accuracy. The big screen is for seeing 19th century French imperial guard dragoon uniforms in full IMAX glory. History as myth is what people want anyway. Like Barbieland. We want *Oppenheimer* to say something about means, ends, and Communism; we want *Napoleon* to say something about inferiority complexes of the powerful, the will to power, and power couples.

Real life has no shortage of drama. Reading [Rhodes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/16884) in preparation for *Oppenheimer* added so much.  On screen, Bohr only got a couple of minutes. But did you know Bohr [almost died from oxygen deprivation](https://warisboring.com/niels-bohrs-flight-from-the-nazis-was-a-science-drama/) during his escape to England? And about a couple [special forces operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage) truly more dramatic than fiction, which were only super effective because the Nazis could not check their work on heavy water not being the only moderator?

In fiction, I most recommend [*My Name is Red*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2517) and [*An Artist of the Floating World*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28922.An_Artist_of_the_Floating_World), which explored the how culture changed through art in places I went to. The commotion over the horse nostrils in *My Name is Red* is also very Morellian. Next year I resolve to read more about places I travel. It's another one of those obvious things that one has to actually plan ahead to do.

Last year I made the unreasonable resolution to read one book a day, and to test one hypothesis a day. I did neither (except for the day I devoured *Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow*). I read fewer books, and the average book I read was shorter. But, I still consider this resolution a success. I spent a lot more time traveling, and yet, I started more books, I read on more days, and I made progress towards testing a hypothesis on more days. I'd set some similar goals this year if I wasn't already trying to set zero goals.

Last year I restated an extension of [Nabeel Qu's](https://nabeelqu.co/advice) and [Dan Wang's](https://danwang.co/2017-letter/) advice. You can have a free lunch across the Pareto front. That has turned out to be true. A bit of everything does compound when accounting everything else. Going places made my reading better, which made my writing better, which made my thinking better, which made my research better. And the cross product of all these things. And other things, like running my first half marathon and discovering antihistamines (why has no one told me about these before).

In June I wrote about [economic bottlenecks to AI](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/). Beyond the obvious learning that collaboration is delightful (and stay with me for one last contrived link), it applies to personal productivity as well. Trying to solve all of my problems at once (on the scale of a project, my entire research portfolio, or my entire life) was easier than hanging my hopes on one. I no longer worry about not being a vim savant, because knowing keyboard bindings is obviously not my bottleneck to getting more done. And while my actual bottlenecks are opaque and distributed, my attentions will be as well.

I will end, as I began this section, talking about paper. Last year I perfected my moka pot setup. This year, I perfected my stationary. At [Itoya in Ginza](https://www.ito-ya.co.jp/) I got this very high quality [A5 book jacket](https://www.piccino.jp/shopdetail/000000000014/bookjacket/page1/order/). After a long candidate search, I accepted some compromise and chose the [Rhodia Goalbook](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_premium_goalbook.php) to wear it. The name is misleading; I won't be putting any goals in there. It's good because it has a hard cover and thick pages. I also don't want to write over the inside leather, so I need its extra calendar pages to buffer. I don't like the dots, but I'm learning to live with it. For complicated reasons including being left-handed, that would take too long to explain, I'm using it upside-down.
